  Stories('The Ugly Duckling','Hans Christian Andersen','images/uglyduckimg.jpg',
      'One fine summer’s day Mother Duck found a lovely spot under a willow tree by the pond to lay her eggs.  She nestled down and waited for them to hatch.After what seemed to her a long time they began to crack which was very exciting.First one little fluffy head appeared and she called him Oscar.Then a second little fluffy head appeared and she called her Maya.Then a third little fluffy head appeared and she called him Henry.Then a fourth little fluffy head appeared and she called her Katie.“Oh what sweet babies I have” she said “what a lucky mother I am.  But what has happened to the fifth egg I sat on?”This egg was bigger than all the rest and showed no sign of cracking.  So, telling the ducklings to be patient and play where she could see them, Mother Duck settled down on the fifth egg.Days later, much to her relief, a tiny crack appeared in the egg.  Slowly it grew bigger and bigger until POP, out came the ugliest ducking she had ever seen.“Oh dear, oh dear” she said “what can have happened?  He doesn’t look at all like his brothers and sisters; he’s much bigger and he’s all grey and straggly”.The other ducklings looked at him “Yuck” they said “what’s that?”“Now, now” said Mother Duck “don’t be nasty, he can’t help what he looks like.  He’s your brother and I’m going to name him Jonathan”.Mother Duck led them onto the pond for their first swimming lesson. As they floated onto the water all they could hear were comments and whispers:“What a funny looking duck!”“Where did he come from?”“I haven’t seen one like that before”.“Is it smelly as well as ugly?”Poor Jonathan, he couldn’t bear it and felt very lonely. His brothers and sisters wouldn’t let him play with them. However much Mother Duck tried to encourage him, and tell him that she loved him, he just wanted to hide away.So one day he decided that the only thing to do was to run away.  That night, when all the others were fast asleep, he crept down to the pond, swam across to the other side, and set off to find a pond of his own.For many days he wandered, but every time he thought he’d found somewhere to stay he heard more whispers:“What an ugly chap”“Have you ever seen a beak like that?”“That’s such a long neck you could tie it in a knot”Poor Jonathan.  He was very sad.Early one evening, as he was moping along, he heard a strange magical noise that seemed to come from the sky.  Looking up he saw the most glorious sight he had ever seen.“I wish I could fly up there with those beautiful birds” he thought.  What he had seen was a flock of swans flying overhead.On and on he went until he came to a river.  To his surprise, the strange birds he had seen in the sky were there floating majestically on the glistening water.  He hid behind some reeds ashamed of his ugly body.  Jonathan couldn’t take his eyes off these graceful white swans.Suddenly, one of the swans caught sight of him peering out from the reeds and swam across to him“Good evening young sir” he said bowing his neck “may I ask your name?”  Because swans are very polite.Jonathan was too overcome to speak, his beak dropped open but no sound came. No-one had been that nice to him before.He took a deep breath and tried again “Ppppppplease sir, mmmmy nnname is Jjjjjjjonathan”.“Well Jonathan” said the swan, “why don’t you come and join us, it’s a beautiful day for a swim”.“Bbbbut you ddddon’t want to be seen with me; I’m so ugly” said Jonathan.“What nonsense” said the swan “whatever makes you think that?  Just look at yourself in the sparkling water”.Jonathan bent his neck and looked down.  To his astonishment he saw, not an ugly grey duckling reflected in the river, but the most beautiful, graceful white swan.“Is that really me?” he asked, forgetting to be nervous.“Of course” answered the swan, “who did you think it was?”Jonathan explained how everyone had been so nasty to him and the swan listened sympathetically.“Well, you’re not ugly now” he said “you’re one of us”.“Oh, how lucky I am” said Jonathan happily.From that day on Jonathan lived with his new friends on the river.  Never again did people say horrid words about him. Each evening as the swans flew over the pond  his brothers and sisters would look up at the sky little knowing that one of them was the brother they had made so unhappy. '),

It was said that he had more gold than any other king in the world.One room of his great castle was almost filled with yellow gold pieces.At last the King grew so fond of his gold that he loved it better than anything else in all the world.He even loved it better than his own little daughter, dear little rosy-cheeked Marigold. His one great wish seemed to be for more and more gold.One day while he was in his gold room counting his money, a beautiful fairy boy stood before him.The boys face shone with a wonderful light, and he had wings on his cap and wings on his feet. In his hand he carried a strange-looking wand, and the wand also had wings.\"Midas, you are the richest man in the world,\"said the fairy. \"There is no King who has so much gold as you.""That may be,\" said the King. \"As you see, I have this room full of gold, but I should like much more; for gold is the best and the most wonderful thing in the world.""Are you sure?\" asked the fairy.\"I am very sure,\" answered the King.\"If I should grant you one wish," said the fairy, "would you ask for more gold?""If I could have but one wish," said the King, "I would ask that everything I touch should turn to beautiful yellow gold.""Your wish shall be granted,\" said the fairy. \"At sunrise to-morrow morning your slightest touch will turn everything into gold. But I warn you that your gift will not make you happy.""I will take the risk,\" said the King.The next day King Midas awoke very early.

Take everything, only give me back my little daughter.\"In a moment the beautiful fairy was standing before him.\"Do you still think that gold is the greatest thing in the world?\" asked the fairy.\"No! no!\" cried the King. \"I hate the very sight of the yellow stuff.""Are you sure that you no longer wish the golden touch?\" asked the fairy.\"I have learned my lesson,\" said the King. \"I no longer think gold the greatest thing in the world.""Very well,\" said the fairy, \"take this pitcher to the spring in the garden and fill it with water. Then sprinkle those things which you have touched and turned to gold.\"The King took the pitcher and rushed to the spring. Running back he first sprinkled the head of his dear little girl.

How eagerly the hungry King ate the bread and butter, the meat, and all the good food!The King hated his golden touch so much that he sprinkled even the chairs and the tables and everything else that the fairy\'s gift had turned to gold.'),
  Stories('Cinderella',' Charles Perrault','images/cinderella.jpeg','Cinderella’s mother died while she was a very little child, leaving her to the care of her father and her step-sisters, who were very much older than herself; for Cinderella’s father had been twice married, and her mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella’s sisters did not love her, and were very unkind to her. As she grew older they made her work as a servant, and even sift the cinders; on which account they used to call her in mockery “Cinderella.” It was not her real name, but she became afterwards so well known by it that her proper one has been forgotten.She was a very sweet-tempered, good girl, however, and everybody (except her cruel sisters) loved her.\nCINDERELLA AT HOME\n.It happened, when Cinderella was about seventeen years old, that the King of that country gave a ball, to which all ladies of the land, and among the rest the young girl’s sisters, were invited. And they made her dress them for the ball, but never thought of allowing her to go there.\nCINDERELLA DRESSING HER SISTERS FOR THE BALL.\n“I wish you would take me to the ball with you,” said Cinderella, meekly.“Take you, indeed!” answered the elder sister, with a sneer; “it is no place for a cinder-sifter: stay at home and do your work.”When they were gone, Cinderella, whose heart was very sad, sat down and cried bitterly; but as she sat sorrowful, thinking of the unkindness of her sisters, a voice called to her from the garden, and she went out to see who was there. It was her godmother, a good old Fairy.“Do not cry, Cinderella,” she said; “you also shall go to the ball, because you are a kind, good girl. Bring me a large pumpkin.”Cinderella obeyed, and the Fairy, touching it with her wand, turned it into a grand coach. Then she desired Cinderella to go to the trap, and bring her a rat. The girl obeyed, and a touch of the Fairy’s wand turned him into a very smart coachman. Two mice were turned into footmen; four grasshoppers into white horses. Next, the Fairy touched Cinderella’s rags, and they became rich satin robes, trimmed with point lace. Diamonds shone in her hair and on her neck and arms, and her kind godmother thought she had seldom seen so lovely a girl. Her old shoes became a charming pair of glass slippers, which shone like diamonds.“Now go to the ball, my love,” she said, “and enjoy yourself. But remember, you must leave the room before the clock strikes eleven. If you do not your dress will return to its original rags. I approve of pleasure, but not of dissipation, and I expect that you will show your gratitude by obeying me.”Cinderella kissed and thanked her godmother. Then she stepped into her coach and drove off, with her footmen behind, in great style. The Fairy, when she was gone, returned to Fairyland.Cinderella was received at the King’s palace with great respect. The Lord Chamberlain bowed low to her, thinking she must be a very great lady by her dress and carriage, and he showed her at once into the ball-room.\nTHE FAIRY GODMOTHER\n.She was so beautiful that everybody looked at her, and wondered who she was; and the Prince asked her to dance with him, and afterwards would dance with no one else.\nARRIVAL AT THE PALACE.\nBut she made haste to leave a little before the hour fixed, and had time to undress before her sisters came home. They told her a beautiful Princess had been at the ball, with whom the Prince was delighted. They did not know it was Cinderella herself, and she was amused to hear them admire her grace and beauty, and say that they were sure she was a royal lady.The Prince was quite vexed when supper-time came, and he could not find his beautiful partner, and no one had seen her leave the room. But in hopes of beholding her again, he persuaded the King to give another grand ball. As soon as her sisters were gone to it, Cinderella’s godmother arrived.“You were so good and obedient last time, that I shall let you go out again,” said she to the young girl.And once more the rat, mice, grasshoppers, and pumpkin (which had gone back to their original shapes after the first ball) were turned into the grand carriage and attendants, and Cinderella, in rose-coloured satin and rubies, went to the royal ball.Directly the Prince saw her, he asked her to dance, and would have no other partner, and as he led her past her two unkind sisters, she saw them look at her dress with envious eyes, and knew that they wished they were as beautiful, and as well-dressed as she was.But in the midst of her enjoyment, Cinderella remembered the Fairy’s command, and at half-past ten glided out of the room, and drove home again. Her sisters found her waiting to undress them in her usual rags, and kept her up to tell her how beautiful the unknown Princess was, and how well she was dressed.Again the Prince was vexed at the sudden disappearance of the beautiful stranger, and once more he persuaded the King to give a grand State ball.“I wonder if Princess Beauty will be there!” said the sisters to Cinderella. “We must have new dresses, for she is so splendid. She makes every one look shabby.”\nCINDERELLA DANCES WITH THE PRINCE\n.Cinderella smiled as she helped them to dress. She was sure the Fairy would let her go to the ball too. And she was right. Her godmother, pleased with her obedience, came in good time, and Cinderella, dressed in blue satin and pearls, went in the same style as before.\nCINDERELLA RUNS HOME AND LOSES HER SLIPPER\n.The Prince would scarcely let her out of his sight, and Cinderella, who was getting a little spoiled by all the flattery she heard, began to think more of herself and less of the Fairy; so the time stole on, till glancing up at the clock, she saw it wanted only five minutes to eleven.At once she darted out of the room, and ran through the palace as fast as she could go, but as she reached the hall, she lost one of her precious glass slippers! She did not stop to pick it up, but rushed to the door. Alas! the clock had struckEleven. She found no coach, only a pumpkin, and the rat and mice ran quickly away when they saw her; while all her fine dress turned to rags, and she had to run home alone in the darkness of the night.The Prince was very much surprised when he missed Cinderella again, and leaving the ball, went in search of her. He asked all the attendants, but no one had seen her, and when enquiry was made of the porter, he said that no one had gone out of the palace except a poor ragged beggar-girl.However, the Prince’s search was rewarded by his finding the glass slipper, which he well knew belonged to the unknown Princess. He loved Cinderella so much that he now resolved to marry her; and as he felt sure that no one else could wear such a tiny shoe as hers was, he sent out a herald to proclaim that whichever lady in his kingdom could put on this glass slipper should be his wife.All the great ladies who wished to be a Princess tried to put it on, but in vain. Cinderella’s sisters tried, but could not get it on, and then Cinderella asked if she might try. They laughed at her; but the Prince, hearing of her wish, sent for her. She went with her sisters in her poor dress, but very clean, and at once put on the slipper. Then she drew the fellow of it from her pocket, and slipped it on her other foot.The Prince, who had thought the moment he saw her that the poor girl was very much like the beautiful Princess, was delighted. He insisted on Cinderella telling him her story, which she did very modestly, and all listened with wonder.\nCINDERELLA TRIES ON THE SLIPPER.\nAs her tale ended, the Fairy godmother suddenly entered the room, and placing her godchild’s hand in the Prince’s, said:“Take this young girl for your wife, Prince; she is good and patient, and as she has known how to submit to injustice meekly, she will know how to reign justly.”\nCINDERELLA MARRIED TO THE PRINCE.\nSo Cinderella was married to the Prince in great state, and they lived together very happily. She forgave her sisters, and treated them always very kindly, and the Prince had great cause to be glad that he had found the glass slipper.'),
  Stories('The Boy Who Cried Wolf','Aesop','images/boy.jpg',' There once was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep.

  Stories('The Ant And The Grasshopper','Aesop','images/ant.jpg',' In a field one summer\'s day a grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart\'s content.  A group of ants walked by, grunting as they struggled to carry plump kernels of corn."Where are you going with those heavy things?" asked the grasshopper.Without stopping, the first ant replied, "To our ant hill.  This is the third kernel I\'ve delivered today.""Why not come and sing with me," teased the grasshopper, \"instead of working so hard?""We are helping to store food for the winter,\" said the ant, \"and think you should do the same.""Winter is far away and it is a glorious day to play,\" sang the grasshopper.But the ants went on their way and continued their hard work.The weather soon turned cold.  All the food lying in the field was covered with a thick white blanket of snow that even the grasshopper could not dig through.  Soon the grasshopper found itself dying of hunger.He staggered to the ants\' hill and saw them handing out corn from the stores they had collected in the summer.  He begged them for something to eat.\"What!\" cried the ants in surprise, \"haven\'t you stored anything away for the winter?  What in the world were you doing all last summer?""I didn\'t have time to store any food,\" complained the grasshopper; \"I was so busy playing music that before I knew it the summer was gone.\"The ants shook their heads in disgust, turned their backs on the grasshopper and went on with their work.'),
  Stories(' Beauty And The Beast','Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve','images/beauty.jpg','A long time ago, in a far away land, a merchant was returning home after a long journey. As night fell, he entered a deep forest. His head was full of thoughts of his six daughters. He had left home in summer, and now he was returning in deep winter. The most bitter sleet and snow came down, and his horse stumbled on a patch of ice. He heard wolves howling, and soon he realised that he was lost.At last, he saw some sort of track. At the beginning it was rough and slippery, but soon it led him into an avenue of orange trees covered with flowers and fruit – but here there was no snow.He saw a flight of stone steps. He went up them into a great castle. Inside he passed through several splendid rooms. Everywhere in the castle there was a deep silence. At last, he stopped in a small room where a fire was burning. He lay down on a couch and very soon fell into a sweet sleep.He woke up feeling hungry. He was still alone, but a good dinner had been laid on a little table. He began to eat, hoping that he might soon have an chance to thank his kind host, whoever it might be - but no one appeared.Then he went down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet. The path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelled such beautiful flowers. Then he remembered a promise he had made to his youngest daughter, who was so lovely that everyone knew her as Beauty. Before setting out on his journey, he had asked his daughters what presents they would like him to bring back for them. The five eldest wished for jewels and fine clothes, but Beauty asked only for a single rose. Now, as he stopped to pick a rose to take home to Beauty, he was startled by a strange noise behind him. Turning around, he saw a frightful ugly Beast, which seemed to be very angry and sad and said in a terrible voice, “Who said that you could pick my roses? Was it not enough that I let you say in my palace and was kind to you? This is the way you thank me, by stealing my flowers! You shall not go unpunished!”The merchant was terrified by these furious words. He dropped the fatal rose, and throwing himself on his knees, cried, “Pardon me, noble sir. I am truly grateful to you for your kindness. I could not imagine that you would mind so much if I took such a little thing as a rose.”The Beast was still furious, however, and cried, “Excuses and flattery will not save you from the death you deserve!”“Alas!” Thought the merchant. “My daughter’s rose has put me in this terrible danger.”He began to tell the Beast of his journey, not forgetting to mention how Beauty had asked him for a rose.“I beg you to forgive me, for I meant no harm,” he pleaded.The Beast thought for a moment, and then he said, in a less terrible voice, “I will forgive you on one condition – that is if you will give me one of your daughters.”“Ah!” Cried the merchant. “What excuse could I invent to bring her here?”“No excuse!” Answered the Beast. “She must come willingly. Go home. I give you a month to see if one of your daughters will save you. If none of them is willing to come to me, you must come back alone. Do not think that you can hide from me, for if you do not keep your word I will come and fetch you!”The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went to the stable where his horse was ready for his journey. It carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight of the palace, and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped before the door of his house.His daughters rushed to meet him. At first he told them nothing of the Beast, but as he gave Beauty her the rose he said sadly, “Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know what it has cost.”Later that evening he told his family of his adventures from beginning to end, and then his daughters wept loudly. The girls were very angry with Beauty, and said to her that it was all her fault, and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her foolish wish.Poor Beauty said to them, “Who could have guessed that asking for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery? But as I made this mistake, it is only right that I should be the one to suffer for it. I will go back to the Beast with father.”When the fatal day came she said goodbye to her sisters and everything she loved. She mounted a horse together with her father, and it seemed to fly rather than gallop. They soon reached the avenue of orange trees, where statues were holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace, music sounded softly from the courtyard.Her father led her to the little room where he had stayed, and there they found a splendid fire burning, and a delicious supper set out on the table.After they had finished their meal they heard the Beast’s footsteps approaching, and Beauty clung to her father. When the ugly Beast appeared she tried hard to hide her terror, and she nodded to him politely.This clearly pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a voice that might have struck fear into the boldest of hearts, “Good evening, old man. Good evening, Beauty.”The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly, “Good evening, Beast.”“Have you come willingly?” Asked the Beast.Beauty answered bravely that she had come willingly to save her father.“I am pleased with you,” said the Beast. “As for you, old man,” he added, turning to the merchant, “at sunrise tomorrow you will go.”Then turning to Beauty, he said, “Take your father into the next room and help him to choose presents for your sisters. Take everything they would wish for.”Then he left them saying, “Goodbye Beauty. Goodbye old man.”In the next room they found splendid dresses fit for a queen. When Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf. After choosing a vast quantity, she opened the last chest, which was full of gold.“I think, father,” she said, “that gold will be more useful to you. We had better take out the other things again, and fill the trunks with gold.” So they did this; and at last the trunks were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!“The Beast was making fun of us,” cried the merchant. “He pretended to give us these things, knowing that I could not carry them away.”“Let us wait and see,” answered Beauty.At sunrise, they went down into the courtyard, where two horses were waiting; one loaded with the two trunks, the other for the merchant to ride. As soon as he climbed into the saddle, he went off at such a pace that Beauty lost sight of him in an instant. Then she began to cry and she went back to her room and fell into a deep sleep.She dreamed that she was walking by a stream when a young prince came up to her and said, in a voice that went straight to her heart, “Ah, Beauty! You are not so unlucky as you suppose. Only try to find me, no matter how I may be disguised, as I love you dearly. Make me happy and you shall be happy. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall have nothing left to wish for.”“What can I do, prince, to make you happy?” Said Beauty.“Do not trust your eyes,” he answered, “and set me free from my misery.”When Beauty awoke, she began to think about the charming prince she had seen in her dream.“He said I could make him happy.” Said Beauty to herself. “It seems that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free? I don’t understand it. After all, it was only a dream, so why should I worry about it?”She got up to explore the castle, but she did not see anyone or hear any sound, and she began to find it rather dull.Only that evening, after supper, she heard the Beast coming, and she trembled with fear at what it might do. But he only said, “Good evening, Beauty.”She answered cheerfully and managed to hide her terror. He spoke politely to her for about an hour, and asked her all about her life with her family.Then he said in a gruff voice, “Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry me?”“Oh! What shall I say?” Cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the Beast angry by refusing.“Say \'yes\' or \'no\' without fear,” he replied.“Oh! No, Beast,” said Beauty, hastily.“Since you will not, goodnight Beauty,” he said.And she answered, “Goodnight, Beast,” very glad to find that he had not attacked her. After he was gone, she was very soon in bed asleep, and dreaming of her unknown prince. He came to her and said to her, “Ah, Beauty! Why are you so unkind to me? I fear I will be unhappy for many a long day still.”The next morning, she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun shone, and all the fountains were playing. When she was tired she went back to the palace, and found a new room full of rare birds, so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and her head. Some of them were parrots and cockatoos that could talk, and they greeted Beauty by name."Pretty little creatures,” she said. “Oh how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room, that I could often hear you sing!" When she left, she opened a door and found that it led straight into her own room.After supper, the Beast paid her his usual visit, and before he left he asked her as before, “Beauty, will you marry me?” And when she refused, he gave her a gruff, “Goodnight” and left her. The days passed, and every evening the Beast asked her the same question and she gave him the same answer.Beauty felt that when she said, “No, Beast,” he went away quite sad. But her happy dreams of the handsome young prince soon made her forget the poor Beast. Her prince always told to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many other equally baffling things which she could not understand.At last, happy as she was, Beauty began to long for her family. One night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her what was the matter. Beauty was no longer afraid of him. Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice. She answered that she was longing to see her home once more.When he heard this, the Beast cried miserably, “Ah! Beauty, have you the heart to leave an unhappy Beast like me? Is it because you hate me that you want to escape?”“No, dear Beast,” answered Beauty softly. “I do not hate you, and I should be very sorry never to see you anymore, but I long to see my father again. Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life.”The Beast replied with a sigh, “I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my life. You may go. But remember your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may be sorry, for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful Beast dead.”Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. When at last she did begin to dream of her beloved prince she saw him stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.“What is the matter?” She cried.He looked at her reproachfully, and said, “How can you ask me, cruel one?”“Ah! Don’t be so sad,” cried Beauty. “I am only going to let my father know that I am safe and happy. I have promised my Beast that I shall come back. I would not cause him pain by breaking my word. He told me he would die if did not keep my promise to him.”“What do you care for an ugly Beast?” Asked the prince.“Oh,” said Beauty, “It is not his fault that he is so ugly. He is a very kind beast.”Just then, she heard someone speaking not very far away. She got up and then she suddenly heard her father’s voice. She rushed out and greeted him. She was home. Her sisters were quite astonished to see her, and there was no end to their questions about her life with the Beast.Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams. After much thought, he answered, “You tell me yourself that The Beast, frightful as he is, loves you dearly and is kind and gentle to you. I think the prince means that you should do as the Beast wishes in spite of his ugliness.”But Beauty’s thoughts were full of her handsome dream prince, and she could not imagine marrying the Beast.When the two months were over, Beauty’s sisters begged her not to return to the ugly beast, but to stay with her family. At first she could not refuse them, and she stayed on for a few days more. Then one night she had a different dream from usual. She saw not her prince, but the Beast. He was lying in a cave and he looked ill and in pain. Then Beauty remember his words that he might die if she did not stay true to her word.The next day, Beauty said goodbye to her father and all her sisters, and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring around upon her finger, and said firmly, “I wish to go back to see my Beast again.”She fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock saying, “Beauty, Beauty,” twelve times in its musical voice, which told her at once that she was in the palace once more. Everything was just as before, and her birds were so glad to see her! Beauty thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to see the Beast again, that she felt as if suppertime would never come.When it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened. She ran down into the garden to search for him. Up and down the paths and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered.At last, quite tired, she stopped for a minute’s rest, and saw that she was standing opposite a cave, and in it lay the Beast, asleep. Quite glad to have found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but to her horror, he did not move or open his eyes.“Oh! He is dead, and it is all my fault,” said Beauty, crying bitterly.But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed. She fetched some water from the nearest fountain and sprinkled it over his face. Slowly, he began to open his eyes.“Ah Beauty,” he said faintly, “now you see what happens when you do not keep your word.”“Oh! Beast,” she cried. “I never knew how much I loved you until now, when I feared I was too late to save your life.”“Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am?” asked the Beast. “You only came just in time. I was dying because I thought you had forgotten your promise. Go back now and rest, I shall see you by and by.”Beauty went back to the palace, where supper was awaiting her; and afterward the Beast came in as usual, and asked about the time she had spent with her family, and if they had all been very glad to see herWhen at last the time came for him to go, and he asked, as he had so often asked before, “Beauty, will you marry me?” She answered softly, “Yes, dear Beast.”As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the palace; fireworks crackled and guns banged, and across the avenue of orange trees, in letters all made of fireflies, was written, “Long live the prince and his bride.”Beauty meant to ask the Beast what it all meant, but he had gone. In his place stood her long-loved prince! At the same moment, two ladies entered the room. Both were splendidly dressed, but one especially so. Her companion said, “Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible magic spell that turned him into a Beast. They love one another, and your consent to their marriage is all they need to make them perfectly happy.”“I agree with all my heart,” cried the queen. Then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the prince.“Now,” said the fairy to Beauty, “I suppose you would like me to send for your father and sisters?”She did so. The marriage was celebrated the very next day, and Beauty and the prince lived happily ever after.'),

  Stories(' The Emperor’s New Clothes','Hans Christian Andersen','images/emporer.jpg','Many years ago there was an Emperor so exceedingly fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on being well dressed. He cared nothing about reviewing his soldiers, going to the theatre, or going for a ride in his carriage, except to show off his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day, and instead of saying, as one might, about any other ruler, "The King\'s in council," here they always said. "The Emperor\'s in his dressing room."In the great city where he lived, life was always gay. Every day many strangers came to town, and among them one day came two swindlers. They let it be known they were weavers, and they said they could weave the most magnificent fabrics imaginable. Not only were their colors and patterns uncommonly fine, but clothes made of this cloth had a wonderful way of becoming invisible to anyone who was unfit for his office, or who was unusually stupid."Those would be just the clothes for me," thought the Emperor. "If I wore them I would be able to discover which men in my empire are unfit for their posts. And I could tell the wise men from the fools. Yes, I certainly must get some of the stuff woven for me right away." He paid the two swindlers a large sum of money to start work at once.They set up two looms and pretended to weave, though there was nothing on the looms. All the finest silk and the purest old thread which they demanded went into their traveling bags, while they worked the empty looms far into the night."I\'d like to know how those weavers are getting on with the cloth," the Emperor thought, but he felt slightly uncomfortable when he remembered that those who were unfit for their position would not be able to see the fabric. It couldn\'t have been that he doubted himself, yet he thought he\'d rather send someone else to see how things were going. The whole town knew about the cloth\'s peculiar power, and all were impatient to find out how stupid their neighbors were."I\'ll send my honest old minister to the weavers,\" the Emperor decided. \"He\'ll be the best one to tell me how the material looks, for he\'s a sensible man and no one does his duty better.\"So the honest old minister went to the room where the two swindlers sat working away at their empty looms.\"Heaven help me,\" he thought as his eyes flew wide open, \"I can\'t see anything at all\". But he did not say so.Both the swindlers begged him to be so kind as to come near to approve the excellent pattern, the beautiful colors. They pointed to the empty looms, and the poor old minister stared as hard as he dared. He couldn\'t see anything, because there was nothing to see. \"Heaven have mercy,\" he thought. \"Can it be that I\'m a fool? I\'d have never guessed it, and not a soul must know. Am I unfit to be the minister? It would never do to let on that I can\'t see the cloth.""Don\'t hesitate to tell us what you think of it,\" said one of the weavers.\"Oh, it\'s beautiful -it\'s enchanting.\" The old minister peered through his spectacles. \"Such a pattern, what colors!" I\'ll be sure to tell the Emperor how delighted I am with it.""We\'re pleased to hear that," the swindlers said. They proceeded to name all the colors and to explain the intricate pattern. The old minister paid the closest attention, so that he could tell it all to the Emperor. And so he did.The swindlers at once asked for more money, more silk and gold thread, to get on with the weaving. But it all went into their pockets. Not a thread went into the looms, though they worked at their weaving as hard as ever.The Emperor presently sent another trustworthy official to see how the work progressed and how soon it would be ready. The same thing happened to him that had happened to the minister. He looked and he looked, but as there was nothing to see in the looms he couldn\'t see anything."Isn\'t it a beautiful piece of goods?" the swindlers asked him, as they displayed and described their imaginary pattern."I know I\'m not stupid," the man thought, "so it must be that I\'m unworthy of my good office. That\'s strange. I mustn\'t let anyone find it out, though." So he praised the material he did not see. He declared he was delighted with the beautiful colors and the exquisite pattern. To the Emperor he said, "It held me spellbound."All the town was talking of this splendid cloth, and the Emperor wanted to see it for himself while it was still in the looms. Attended by a band of chosen men, among whom were his two old trusted officials-the ones who had been to the weavers-he set out to see the two swindlers. He found them weaving with might and main, but without a thread in their looms."Magnificent," said the two officials already duped. "Just look, Your Majesty, what colors! What a design!" They pointed to the empty looms, each supposing that the others could see the stuff."What\'s this?" thought the Emperor. "I can\'t see anything. This is terrible!Am I a fool? Am I unfit to be the Emperor? What a thing to happen to me of all people! - Oh! It\'s very pretty," he said. "It has my highest approval." And he nodded approbation at the empty loom. Nothing could make him say that he couldn\'t see anything.His whole retinue stared and stared. One saw no more than another, but they all joined the Emperor in exclaiming, "Oh! It\'s very pretty," and they advised him to wear clothes made of this wonderful cloth especially for the great procession he was soon to lead. "Magnificent! Excellent! Unsurpassed!" were bandied from mouth to mouth, and everyone did his best to seem well pleased. The Emperor gave each of the swindlers a cross to wear in his buttonhole, and the title of "Sir Weaver."Before the procession the swindlers sat up all night and burned more than six candles, to show how busy they were finishing the Emperor\'s new clothes. They pretended to take the cloth off the loom. They made cuts in the air with huge scissors. And at last they said, "Now the Emperor\'s new clothes are ready for him."Then the Emperor himself came with his noblest noblemen, and the swindlers each raised an arm as if they were holding something. They said, "These are the trousers, here\'s the coat, and this is the mantle," naming each garment. "All of them are as light as a spider web. One would almost think he had nothing on, but that\'s what makes them so fine.""Exactly," all the noblemen agreed, though they could see nothing, for there was nothing to see."If Your Imperial Majesty will condescend to take your clothes off," said the swindlers, "we will help you on with your new ones here in front of the long mirror."The Emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put his new clothes on him, one garment after another. They took him around the waist and seemed to be fastening something - that was his train-as the Emperor turned round and round before the looking glass."How well Your Majesty\'s new clothes look. Aren\'t they becoming!" He heard on all sides, "That pattern, so perfect! Those colors, so suitable! It is a magnificent outfit."Then the minister of public processions announced: "Your Majesty\'s canopy is waiting outside.""Well, I\'m supposed to be ready," the Emperor said, and turned again for one last look in the mirror. "It is a remarkable fit, isn\'t it?" He seemed to regard his costume with the greatest interest.The noblemen who were to carry his train stooped low and reached for the floor as if they were picking up his mantle. Then they pretended to lift and hold it high. They didn\'t dare admit they had nothing to hold.So off went the Emperor in procession under his splendid canopy. Everyone in the streets and the windows said, \"Oh, how fine are the Emperor\'s new clothes! Don\'t they fit him to perfection? And see his long train!\" Nobody would confess that he couldn\'t see anything, for that would prove him either unfit for his position, or a fool. No costume the Emperor had worn before was ever such a complete success.\"But he hasn\'t got anything on,\" a little child said.\"Did you ever hear such innocent prattle?\" said its father. And one person whispered to another what the child had said, \"He hasn\'t anything on. A child says he hasn\'t anything on."\"But he hasn\'t got anything on!\" the whole town cried out at last.The Emperor shivered, for he suspected they were right. But he thought, \"This procession has got to go on.\" So he walked more proudly than ever, as his noblemen held high the train that wasn\'t there at all.'),
  Stories('Aladdin and the Magic Lamp ','','images/aladdin2.jpg','A long time ago, in Persia, a poor boy called Aladdin was playing with his friends in the streets of his city. A stranger came up to him and asked him if he was the son of Mustapha the Tailor. “I am, sir,” replied Aladdin, “but he died a long while ago.” When the stranger heard this, he embraced Aladdin saying: “My boy – I am your long lost uncle.” Aladdin ran home and told his mother all about this newly found relative, and she prepared supper for them all.The next day, the uncle led Aladdin out far beyond the city gates. They journeyed onwards until late afternoon, but Aladdin did not feel tired because his uncle told him so many interesting stories. Eventually they reached the foot of a mountain.“We will go no farther,” said the false uncle – for in truth he was not Aladdin’s relative, but an African magician in disguise. “I will show you something wonderful,” he said. The magician lit a fire and threw some powder on it while saying some magical words. The earth trembled a little and a large boulder rolled to one side. Aladdin saw a flight of steps leading down into a dark cave. The opening was just large enough for a boy to pass through, but plainly the magician, who was rather fat, would not have managed to enter the cave himself. “Go down,” commanded the magician, “at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls. Pass through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk on until you come to a table upon which stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it to me.”Aladdin was afraid to disobey the magician, and went down the stairs into the cave. On the ground he found a ring, and despite the magician’s order not to touch anything, he picked it up and slipped it onto his finger. He did not die. Then he passed through the garden where he picked fruit from the trees. Later on, he found the lamp, just as the magician had said, and he went back up the stairs to the mouth of the cave. The magician cried out: “Make haste and give me the lamp.” But Aladdin saw through his trick and understood that as soon as he handed over the lamp, the magician would replace the stone and he would be shut inside the cave, never to leave. And so Aladdin called out: “Let me out first, and only then will I give you the lamp.” The magician flew into a terrible rage, and throwing some more powder on to the fire, he said some more magic words, and the stone rolled back into its place.For two days Aladdin remained trapped inside the cave. At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring that he had picked off the ground. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: “What wouldst thou with me? I am the slave of the ring, and will obey thee in all things.” Aladdin fearlessly replied: “Deliver me from this place!” Whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself back at home. “Alas! child,” said his mother when she noticed him. “I have nothing to eat in the house. We will go hungry tonight.” Aladdin soothed her saying he would sell the lamp to get some money for food. As it was very dirty his mother began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: “Fetch me something to eat!” The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine. Aladdin’s mother, when she came to herself, said: “Where did you get this splendid feast?” “Ask not, but eat,” replied Aladdin.One day the Sultan who ruled the city ordered that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess, his daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The princess looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home and told his mother that he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her. His mother burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last persuaded her to go to the Sultan and request his daughter’s hand in marriage for her son. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan. After waiting several days at the palace, she was admitted to see the him. She threw herself down at the foot of the throne and waited for several minutes until the Sultan said to her: “Old woman, tell me what you want.” She hesitated, then told him of her son’s love for the princess, only at the last moment remembering to open the napkin that contained the magical jewels. When the Sultan saw this wonderful present he was thunderstruck, and turning to his chief adviser, the grand Vizier, he said: “Ought I not to give the princess to one who values her at such a price?” The Vizier, who was hoping that his own son would marry the princess, begged the Sultan to delay the wedding for three months, during which time he hoped to make him a richer present. The Sultan agreed.Aladdin waited patiently for his wedding day in three months time, but after two months his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found everyone rejoicing, and asked what was going on. “Do you not know,” was the answer, “that the son of the grand Vizier is to marry the Sultan’s daughter tonight?” Aladdin, who was stunned when he heard the news. but presently he took down the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared, saying, “What is thy will?” Aladdin replied: “The Sultan has broken his promise to me, and the Vizier’s son is to marry the princess. My command is that that you bring the princess here so that the scoundral can’t have her.” “Your wish is my command” said the genie, and in an instant the princess was sitting in Aladdin’s room still wearing her wedding dress. He told her not to be afraid, but she was utterly confused and quite terrified. The next morning, the genie took her back to the palace.The princess told her mother how she had been carried by magic to some strange house. Her mother did not believe her in the least, and the Sultan ordered that the wedding should take place that evening instead.The following night exactly the same thing happened. The Sultan was furious and even considered having his daughter’s head cut off. He summoned the Vizier’s son. “Plainly my daughter is hiding from you,” he said. “Do you still wish to marry her?”“Well” said the young man who was very proud and arrogant: “If the princess does not obey her father, the great Sultan, what hope is that she will make me a good wife? I give up my claim over her. Better that she marry the poorest beggar if that’s what she wants.”When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before, and the Sultan, on seeing her poverty felt less inclined than ever to keep his word. The Vizier advised him to set so high a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it. The Sultan then turned to Aladdin’s mother, saying: “Good woman, a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your son must first send me forty basins of gold full of jewels. Tell him that I await his answer.”When he heard this, Aladdin summoned up his genie and soon eighty slaves, splendidly dressed, were waiting in the alleyway outside his house. The slaves were carrying forty golden basins, brimming with jewels.Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to marry him to the princess that very day. But Aladdin refused, saying: “I must build a palace fit for her,” and took his leave. Once home, he said to the genie: “Build me a palace of the finest marble, with four and twenty windows set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones.At night the princess said goodbye to her father, and set out for Aladdin’s palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her. “Princess,” he said, “blame your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.” After the wedding had taken place, Aladdin led her into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she suppered with him, after which they danced till midnight.But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his magic arts discovered that instead of perishing miserably in the cave, he had escaped, and had married a princess. He travelled night and day until he reached the city of Persia where Aladdin lived. Half mad with rage, he was determined to get hold of the lamp, and again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.Unluckily, Aladdin had gone hunting for eight days, which gave the magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them into a basket, and went to the palace, crying: “New lamps for old!” Followed by a jeering crowd, laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones?One of the palace slaves said to the princess: “There is an old lamp on the cornice there which he can have.” Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could not take it out hunting with him. The princess, not knowing its value, went and said to the magician: “Give me a new lamp for this.” He snatched it amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared. He went out of the city gates to a lonely place where he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared, and at the magician’s command carried him, together with the palace and the princess in it, to far off Africa.Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window toward Aladdin’s palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. The Vizier put the strange disappearance of the palace and his daughter down to black magic, and this time the Sultan believed him. He and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains. “False wretch!” said the Sultan. “Where is my palace and my daughter?” Aladdin had no answer, but begged to be given forty days to discover the cause of the disaster. This the Sultan granted. For three days Aladdin wandered about like a madman, asking everyone what had become of his palace, but they only laughed and pitied him. He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore. The genie appeared, and asked his will. “Save my life, Genie,” said Aladdin, “bring my palace back.” “That is not in my power,” said the genie. “I am only the slave of the ring; you must ask him of the lamp.” “Even so,” said Aladdin, “but thou canst take me to the palace, and set me down under my dear wife’s window.” He at once found himself in Africa, under the window of the princess.That morning the princess rose early and opened the window, and at the noise she made, Aladdin looked up. She was astonished and delighted to see her dear husband’s face. After he had kissed her, Aladdin said: “I beg of you, Princess, in God’s name, tell me what has become of my old lamp. “Alas!” she said, “I am the innocent cause of our sorrows,” and she told him of the exchange of the lamp.Aladdin comforted her, and gave her a small bottle containing a certain powder. “Put on your most beautiful dress,” he said to her “and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have forgotten me. Invite him to supper with you, and say you wish to taste the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will tell you what to do.”That evening she received the magician, saying, to his great amazement: “I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited you to supper with me, but let us try some wine of Africa.” The magician flew to his cellar, and the princess put the powder that Aladdin had given her into his cup. When he returned the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty, but the princess cut him short, saying: “Let us drink first, and you shall say what you will afterward.” She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless. Aladdin came into the room, went to the dead magician, took the lamp out of his clothes, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to Persia. This was done in an instant.The Sultan, who was sitting in his chamber, mourning for his lost daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for there stood the palace as before! He hastened over to it, and Aladdin received him with the princess at his side. He told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the magician, that he might believe. A ten days’ feast was proclaimed, and it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace; but it was not to be.The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself. He travelled to Persia to avenge his brother’s death, and disguised himself in skirts and veils so that he looked exactly like a famous holy woman called Fatima. Then he went toward the palace of Aladdin, and all the people, thinking he was the holy woman, gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing. The princess, who had long desired to see Fatima, sent for her. She showed Fatima the palace, and asked what she thought of it. “It is truly beautiful,” said the false Fatima. “In my mind it wants but one thing.” “And what is that?” said the princess. “If only a roc’s egg,” replied he, “were hung up from the middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.”After this the princess could think of nothing but the roc’s egg, and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill mood. She told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc’s egg hanging from the dome. “If that is all,” replied Aladdin, “you shall soon be happy.” He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a roc’s egg. The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook. “Wretch!” he cried, “is it not enough that I have done everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes, but this request does not come from you, but from the brother of the African magician, whom you destroyed. He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman. He, it was who put that wish into your wife’s head. Take care of yourself, for he means to kill you.” So saying, the genie disappeared.Aladdin went back to the princess, saying his head ached, and requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger, pierced him to the heart. “What have you done?” cried the princess. “You have killed the holy woman!” “Not so,” replied Aladdin, “but a wicked magician,” and told her of how she had been deceived.After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace. He succeeded the Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind him a long line of kings.'),
  Stories(' Fair, Brown and Trembling','Jude Daly','images/fair2.jpg','KING AEDH CURUCHA lived in Tir Conal, and he had three daughters, whose names were Fair, Brown, and Trembling.Fair and Brown had new dresses, and went to church every Sunday. Trembling was kept at home to do the cooking and work. They would not let her go out of the house at all; for she was more beautiful than the other two, and they were in dread she might marry before themselves.They carried on in this way for seven years. At the end of seven years the son of the king of Omanya [The ancient Emania in Ulster] fell in love with the eldest sister.One Sunday morning, after the other two had gone to church, the old henwife came into the kitchen to Trembling, and said: " It\'s at church you ought to be this day, instead of working here at home.""How could I go?" said Trembling. "I have no clothes good enough to wear at church and if my sisters were to see me there, they \'d kill me for going out of the house.""I\'II give you," said the henwife, a finer dress than either of them has ever seen. And now tell me what dress will you have?""I\'II have," said Trembling, "a dress as white as snow, and green shoes for my feet."Then the henwife put on the cloak of darkness, clipped a piece from the old clothes the young woman had on, and asked for the whitest robes in the world and the most beautiful that could be found, and a pair of green shoes.That moment she had the robe and the shoes, and she brought them to Trembling, who put them on. When Trembling was dressed and ready, the henwife said: " I have a honey-bird here to sit on your right shoulder, and a honey-finger to put on your left. At the door stands a milk-white mare, with a golden saddle for you to sit on, and a golden bridle to hold in your hand."Trembling sat on the golden saddle; and when she was ready to start, the henwife said: "You must not go inside the door of the church, and the minute the people rise up at the end of Mass, do you make off, and ride home as fast as the mare will carry you."When Trembling came to the door of the church there was no one inside who could get a glimpse of her but was striving to know who she was; and when they saw her hurrying away at the end of Mass, they ran out to overtake her. But no use in their running; she was away before any man could come near her. From the minute she left the church till she got home, she overtook the wind before her, and outstripped the wind behind.She came down at the door, went in, and found the henwife had dinner ready. She put off the white robes, and had on her old dress in a twinkling.When the two sisters came home the henwife asked: "Have you any news to-day from the church?""We have great news," said they. " We saw a wonderful, grand lady at the church-door. The like of the robes she had we have never seen on woman before. It\'s little that was thought of our dresses beside what she had on; and there wasn\'t a man at the church, from the king to the beggar, but was trying to look at her and know who she was."The sisters would give no peace till they had two dresses like the robes of the strange lady; but honey-birds and honey-fingers were not to be found.Next Sunday the two sisters went to church again, and left the youngest at home to cook the dinner.After they had gone, the henwife came in and asked: "Will you go to church to-day?""I would go," said Trembling, " if I could get the going.""What robe will you wear?" asked the hen-wife."The finest black satin that can be found, and red shoes for my feet.""What color do you want the mare to be?""I want her to be so black and so glossy that I can see myself in her body."The henwife put on the cloak of darkness, and asked for the robes and the mare. That moment she had them. When Trembling was dressed, the henwife put the honey-bird on her right shoulder and the honey-finger on her left. The saddle on the mare was silver, and so was the bridle.When Trembling sat in the saddle and was going away, the henwife ordered her strictly not to go inside the door of the church, but to rush away as soon as the people rose at the end of Mass, and hurry home on the mare before any man could stop her.That Sunday the people were more astonished than ever, and gazed at her more than the first time; and all they were thinking of was to know who she was. But they had no chance; for the moment the people rose at the end of Mass she slipped from the church, was in the silver saddle, and home before a man could stop her or talk to her.The henwife had the dinner ready. Trembling took off her satin robe, and had on her old clothes before her sisters got home."What news have you to-day?" asked the henwife of the sisters when they came from the church."Oh, we saw the grand strange lady again! And it\'s little that any man could think of our dresses after looking at the robes of satin that she had on! And all at church, from high to low, had their mouths open, gazing at her, and no man was looking at us."The two sisters gave neither rest nor peace till they got dresses as nearly like the strange lad\'s robes as they could find. Of course they were not so good; for the like of those robes could not be found in Erin.When the third Sunday came, Fair and Brown went to church dressed in black satin. They left Trembling at home to work in the kitchen, and told her to be sure and have dinner ready when they came back.After they had gone and were out of sight, the henwife came to the kitchen and said: "Well, my dear, are you for church to-day?""I would go if I had a new dress to wear.""I\'ll get you any dress you ask for. What dress would you like? " asked the henwife."A dress red as a rose from the waist down, and white as snow from the waist up; a cape of green on my shoulders; and a hat on my head with a red, a white, and a green feather in it; and shoes for my feet with the toes red, the middle white, and the backs and heels green."The henwife put on the cloak of darkness, wished for all these things, and had them. When Trembling was dressed, the henwife put the honey-bird on her right shoulder and the honey-finger on her left, and placing the hat on her head, clipped a few hairs from one lock and a few from another with her scissors, and that moment the most beautiful golden hair was flowing down over the girl\'s shoulders. Then the henwife asked what kind of a mare she would ride. She said white, with blue and gold-colored diamond-shaped spots all over her body, on her back a saddle of gold, and on her head a golden bridle.The mare stood there before the door, and a bird sitting between her ears, which began to sing as soon as Trembling was in the saddle, and never stopped till she came home from the church.The fame of the beautiful strange lady had gone out through the world, and all the princes and great men that were in it came to church that Sunday, each one hoping that it was himself would have her home with him after Mass.The son of the king of Omanya forgot all about the eldest sister, and remained outside the church, so as to catch the strange lady before she could hurry away.The church was more crowded than ever before, and there were three times as many outside. There was such a throng before the church that Trembling could only come inside the gate.As soon as the people were rising at the end of Mass, the lady slipped out through the gate, was in the golden saddle in an instant, and sweeping away ahead of the wind. But if she was, the prince of Omanya was at her side, and, seizing her by the foot, he ran with the mare for thirty perches, and never let go of the beautiful lady till the shoe was pulled from her foot, and he was left behind with it in his hand. She came home as fast as the mare could carry her, and was thinking all the time that the henwife would kill her for losing the shoe.Seeing her so vexed and so changed in the face, the old woman asked: " What\'s the trouble that \'s on you now?""Oh! I\'ve lost one of the shoes off my feet," said Trembling."Don\'t mind that; don\'t be vexed," said the hen-wife; "maybe it\'s the best thing that ever happened to you."Then Trembling gave up all the things she had to the henwife, put on her old clothes, and went to work in the kitchen. When the sisters came home, the henwife asked: "Have you any news from the church?""We have indeed," said they; " for we saw the grandest sight to-day. The strange lady came again, in grander array than before. On herself and the horse she rode were the finest colors of the world, and between the ears of the horse was a bird which never stopped singing from the time she came till she went away. The lady herself is the most beautiful woman ever seen by man in Erin."After Trembling had disappeared from the church, the son of the king of Omanya said to the other kings\' sons: \"I will have that lady for my own.\"They all s baid: \"You didn\'t win her just by taking the shoe off her foot, you \'II have to win her by the point of the sword; you\'ll have to fight for her with us before you can call her your own.""Well,\" said the son of the king of Omanya, \"when I find the lady that shoe will fit, I\'ll fight for her, never fear, before I leave her to any of you.\"Then all the kings\' sons were uneasy, and anxious to know who was she that lost the shoe; and they began to travel all over Erin to know could they find her. The prince of Omanya and all the others went in a great company together, and made the round of Erin; they went every-where, - north, south, east, and west. They visited every place where a woman was to be found, and left not a house in the kingdom they did not search, to know could they find the woman the shoe would fit, not caring whether she was rich or poor, of high or low degree.The prince of Omanya always kept the shoe; and when the young women saw it, they had great hopes, for it was of proper size, neither large nor small, and it would beat any man to know of what material it was made. One thought it would fit her if she cut a little from her great toe; and another, with too short a foot, put something in the tip of her stocking. But no use, they only spoiled their feet, and were curing them for months afterwards.The two sisters, Fair and Brown, heard that the princes of the world were looking all over Erin for the woman that could wear the shoe, and every day they were talking of trying it on; and one day Trembling spoke up and said: \"Maybe it\'s my foot that the shoe will fit.""Oh, the breaking of the dog\'s foot on you! Why say so when you were at home every Sunday?\"They were that way waiting, and scolding the younger sister, till the princes were near the place. The day they were to come, the sisters put Trembling in a closet, and locked the door on her. When the company came to the house, the prince of Omanya gave the shoe to the sisters. But though they tried and tried, it would fit neither of them.\"Is there any other young woman in the house?\" asked the prince.\"There is,\" said Trembling, speaking up in the closet; \"I\'m here.""Oh! we have her for nothing but to put out the ashes,\" said the sisters.But the prince and the others wouldn\'t leave the house till they had seen her; so the two sisters had to open the door. When Trembling came out, the shoe was given to her, and it fitted exactly.The prince of Omanya looked at her and said:\"You are the woman the shoe fits, and you are the woman I took the shoe from.\"Then Trembling spoke up, and said: \" Do you stay here till I return.\"Then she went to the henwife\'s house. The old woman put on the cloak of darkness, got everything for her she had the first Sunday at church, and put her on the white mare in the same fashion. Then Trembling rode along the highway to the front of the house. All who saw her the first time said: \" This is the lady we saw at church.\"Then she went away a second time, and a second time came back on the black mare in the second dress which the henwife gave her. All who saw her the second Sunday said: \"That is the lady we saw at church.\"A third time she asked for a short absence, and soon came back on the third mare and in the third dress. All who saw her the third time said That is the lady we saw at church.\" Every man was satisfied, and knew that she was the woman.Then all the princes and great men spoke up, and said to the son of the king of Omanya:\"You \'II have to fight now for her before we let her go with you.""I\'m here before you, ready for combat,\" answered the prince.Then the son of the king of Lochlm stepped forth. The struggle began, and a terrible struggle it was. They fought for nine hours; and then the son of the king of LochIin stopped, gave up his claim, and left the field. Next day the son of the king of Spain fought six hours, and yielded his claim. On the third day the son of the king of Nyerfói fought eight hours, and stopped. The fourth day the son of the king of Greece fought six hours, and stopped. On the fifth day no more strange princes wanted to fight; and all the sons of kings in Erin said they would not fight with a man of their own land, that the strangers had had their chance, and as no others came to claim the woman, she belonged of right to the son of the king of Omanya.The marriage-day was fixed, and the invitations were sent out. The wedding lasted for a year and a day. When the wedding was over, the king\'s son brought home the bride, and when the time came a son was born. The young woman sent for her eldest sister, Fair, to be with her and care for her. One day, when Trembling was well, and when her husband was away hunting, the two sisters went out to walk; and when they came to the seaside, the eldest pushed the youngest sister in. A great whale came and swallowed her.The eldest sister came home alone, and the husband asked, \"Where is your sister?\"She has gone home to her father in Ballyshannon; now that I am well, I don\'t need her.""Well,\" said the husband, looking at her, \"I\'m in dread it\'s my wife that has gone.""Oh! no,\" said she; \" it\'s my sister Fair that\'s gone.\"Since the sisters were very much alike, the prince was in doubt. That night he put his sword between them, and said: \" If you are my wife, this sword will get warm; if not, it will stay cold.\"In the morning when he rose up, the sword was as cold as when he put it there.It happened when the two sisters were walking by the seashore, that a little cowboy was down by the water minding cattle, and saw Fair push Trembling into the sea; and next day, when the tide came in, he saw the whale swim up and throw her out on the sand. When she was on the sand she said to the cowboy: \" When you go home in the evening with the cows, tell the master that my sister Fair pushed me into the sea yesterday; that a whale swallowed me, and then threw me out, but will come again and swallow me with the coming of the next tide; then he\'Il go out with the tide, and come again with tomorrow\'s tide, and throw me again on the strand. The whale will cast me out three times. I\'m under the enchantment of this whale, and cannot leave the beach or escape myself. Unless my husband saves me before I\'m swallowed the fourth time I shall be lost. He must come and shoot the whale with a silver bullet when he turns on the broad of his back. Under the breast-fin of the whale is a reddish-brown spot. My husband must hit him in that spot, for it is the only place in which he can be killed.\"When the cowboy got home, the eldest sister gave him a draught of oblivion, and he did not tell.Next day he went again to the sea. The whale came and cast Trembling on shore again. She asked the boy: \" Did you tell the master what I told you to tell him?""I did not,\" said he; \" I forgot.""How did you forget?\" asked she.\"The woman of the house gave me a drink that made me forget.\"\"Well, don\'t forget telling him this night; and if she gives you a drink, don\'t take it from her.\"As soon as the cowboy came home, the eldest sister offered him a drink. He refused to take it till be had delivered his message and told all to the master. The third day the prince went down with his gun and a silver bullet in it. He was not long down when the whale came and threw Trembling upon the beach as the two days before. She had no power to speak to her husband till he had killed the whale. Then the whale went out, turned over once on the broad of his back, and showed the spot for a moment only. That moment the prince fired. He had but the one chance, and a short one at that; but he took it, and hit the spot, and the whale, mad with pain, made the sea all around red with blood, and died.That minute Trembling was able to speak, and went home with her husband, who sent word to her father what the eldest sister had done. The father came, and told him any death he chose to give her to give it. The prince told the father he would leave her life and death with himself. The father had her put out then on the sea in a barrel, with provisions in it for seven years.In time Trembling had a second child, a daughter. The prince and she sent the cowboy to school, and trained him up as one of their own children, and said: \"If the little girl that is born to us now lives, no other man in the world will get her but him.\"The cowboy and the prince\'s daughter lived on till they were married. The mother said to her husband:\" You could not have saved me from the whale but for the little cowboy; on that account I don\'t grudge him my daughter.\"The son of the king of Omanya and Trembling had fourteen children, and they lived happily till the two died of old age.'),
  Stories(' The Golden Goose','Grimm','images/gold2.jpg','There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling, and was despised, mocked, and put down on every occasion.It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.When he entered the forest there met him a little grey-haired old man who bade him good-day, and said, "Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty." But the prudent youth answered, "If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you," and he left the little man standing and went on.But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\'s doing.After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son, too, said with much reason, "What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!" and he left the little man standing and went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few strokes at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home.Then Dummling said, "Father, do let me go and cut wood." The father answered, "Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it." But Dummling begged so long that at last he said, "Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself." His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said, "Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty." Dummling answered, "I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat." So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said, "Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots." Then the little man took leave of him.Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers.The eldest thought, "I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather," and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast.At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out, "Keep away; for goodness\' sake keep away!" But she did not understand why she was to keep away. "The others are there," she thought, "I may as well be there too," and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night with the goose.The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, just as he was inclined to go.In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said, "For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? is that seemly?" At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind.Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out, "Hi, your reverence, whither away so quickly? do not forget that we have a christening to-day!" and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it.Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the King\'s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never leave off. Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife, and the wedding was celebrated. After the King\'s death, Dummling inherited the kingdom and lived a long time contentedly with his wife.'),
  Stories(' Little Red Riding Hood','Leanne Guenther','images/red.jpg','Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they\'d seen each other."That\'s a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye."Remember, go straight to Grandma\'s house," her mother cautioned.  "Don\'t dawdle along the way and please don\'t talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous.""Don\'t worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I\'ll be careful."But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more.Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn\'t notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her."What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster."I\'m on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma\'s house.The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma\'s and knocked lightly at the door."Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny\'s wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny\'s perfume behind his pointy ears.A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice."It\'s me, Little Red Riding Hood.""Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother."Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked."Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point."But Grandmother!  What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed."The better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf."But Grandmother!  What big eyes you have," said Little Red Riding Hood."The better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf."But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly."The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.Almost too late, Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf.She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Wolf!" as loudly as she could.A woodsman who was chopping logs nearby heard her cry and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.He grabbed the wolf and made him spit out the poor Grandmother who was a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece."Oh Grandma, I was so scared!"  sobbed Little Red Riding Hood, "I\'ll never speak to strangers or dawdle in the forest again.""There, there, child.  You\'ve learned an important lesson.  Thank goodness you shouted loud enough for this kind woodsman to hear you!"The woodsman knocked out the wolf and carried him deep into the forest where he wouldn\'t bother people any longer.Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother had a nice lunch and a long chat.'),
  Stories(' The Selfish Giant','Oscar Wilde','images/giant.jpg','Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant’s garden.It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers likestars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink andpearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used tostop their games in order to listen to them. “How happy we are here!” they cried to each other.One day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him forseven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited,and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody toplay in it but myself.” So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTEDHe was a very selfish Giant.The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty andfull of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons wereover, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. “How happy we were there,” they said to each other.Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the gardenof the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the treesforgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board itwas so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only peoplewho were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. “Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will livehere all the year round.” The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all thetrees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and heroared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. “This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we mustask the Hail on a visit.” So the Hail came. Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till hebroke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed ingrey, and his breath was like ice.“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window andlooked out at his cold white garden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather.”But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to theGiant’s garden she gave none. “He is too selfish,” she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to hisears that he thought it must be the King’s musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside hiswindow, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the mostbeautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring,and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said theGiant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.What did he see?He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they weresitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were soglad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their armsgently above the children’s heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers werelooking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. Itwas the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reachup to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quitecovered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. “Climb up! little boy,” saidthe Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.And the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out. “How selfish I have been!” he said; “now I know why theSpring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down thewall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever and ever.” He was really very sorry for what hehad done.So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when thechildren saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only thelittle boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stoleup behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once intoblossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them roundthe Giant’s neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked anylonger, came running back, and with them came the Spring. “It is your garden now, little children,” said theGiant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at twelveo’clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.“But where is your little companion?” he said: “the boy I put into the tree.” The Giant loved him the bestbecause he had kissed him.“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant. But the children said that they didnot know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whomthe Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first littlefriend, and often spoke of him. “How I would like to see him!” he used to say.Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in ahuge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. “I have many beautiful flowers,”he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.”One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the Winter now, for heknew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous sight. In thefarthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden,and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass, and came near tothe child. And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to woundthee?” For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on thelittle feet.“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.”“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shallcome with me to my garden, which is Paradise.”And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered withwhite blossoms.'),
  Stories(' The Reluctant Dragon',' Kenneth Grahame','images/reluctant.jpg','FOOTPRINTS in the snow have been unfailing provokers of sentiment ever since snow was first a white wonder in this drab-coloured world of ours. In a poetry-book presented to one of us by an aunt, there was a poem by one Wordsworth, in which they stood out strongly—with a picture all to themselves, too—but we didn\'t think very highly either of the poem or the sentiment. Footprints in the sand, now, were quite another matter, and we grasped Crusoe\'s attitude of mind much more easily than Wordsworth\'s. Excitement and mystery, curiosity and suspense—these were the only sentiments that tracks, whether in sand or in snow, were able to arouse in us.We had awakened early that winter morning, puzzled at first by the added light that filled the room. Then, when the truth at last fully dawned on us and we knew that snow-balling was no longer a wistful dream, but a solid certainty waiting for us outside, it was a mere brute fight for the necessary clothes, and the lacing of boots seemed a clumsy invention, and the buttoning of coats an unduly tedious form of fastening, with all that snow going to waste at our very door.When dinner-time came we had to be dragged in by the scruff of our necks. The short armistice over, the combat was resumed; but presently Charlotte and I, a little weary of contests and of missiles that ran shudderingly down inside one\'s clothes, forsook the trampled battle-field of the lawn and went exploring the blank virgin spaces of the white world that lay beyond. It stretched away unbroken on every side of us, this mysterious soft garment under which our familiar world had so suddenly hidden itself. Faint imprints showed where a casual bird had alighted, but of other traffic there was next to no sign; which made these strange tracks all the more puzzling.We came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery, and pored over them long, our hands on our knees. Experienced trappers that we knew ourselves to be, it was annoying to be brought up suddenly by a beast we could not at once identify."Don\'t you know?" said Charlotte, rather scornfully. "Thought you knew all the beasts that ever was."This put me on my mettle, and I hastily rattled off a string of animal names embracing both the arctic and the tropic zones, but without much real confidence."No," said Charlotte, on consideration; "they won\'t any of \'em quite do. Seems like something lizardy. Did you say a iguanodon? Might be that, p\'raps. But that\'s not British, and we want a real British beast. I think it\'s a dragon!""\'Tisn\'t half big enough," I objected."Well, all dragons must be small to begin with," said Charlotte: "like everything else. P\'raps this is a little dragon who\'s got lost. A little dragon would be rather nice to have. He might scratch and spit, but he couldn\'t do anything really. Let\'s track him down!"So we set off into the wide snow-clad world, hand in hand, our hearts big with expectation,—complacently confident that by a few smudgy traces in the snow we were in a fair way to capture a half-grown specimen of a fabulous beast.We ran the monster across the paddock and along the hedge of the next field, and then he took to the road like any tame civilised taxpayer. Here his tracks became blended with and lost among more ordinary footprints, but imagination and a fixed idea will do a great deal, and we were sure we knew the direction a dragon would naturally take. The traces, too, kept reappearing at intervals—at least Charlotte maintained they did, and as it was her dragon I left the following of the slot to her and trotted along peacefully, feeling that it was an expedition anyhow and something was sure to come out of it.Charlotte took me across another field or two, and through a copse, and into a fresh road; and I began to feel sure it was only her confounded pride that made her go on pretending to see dragon-tracks instead of owning she was entirely at fault, like a reasonable person. At last she dragged me excitedly through a gap in a hedge of an obviously private character; the waste, open world of field and hedgerow disappeared, and we found ourselves in a garden, well-kept, secluded, most undragon-haunted in appearance. Once inside, I knew where we were. This was the garden of my friend the circus-man, though I had never approached it before by a lawless gap, from this unfamiliar side. And here was the circus-man himself, placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the walks. I stepped up to him and asked him politely if he had lately seen a Beast."May I inquire," he said, with all civility, "what particular sort of a Beast you may happen to be looking for?""It\'s a lizardy sort of Beast," I explained. "Charlotte says it\'s a dragon, but she doesn\'t really know much about beasts."The circus-man looked round about him slowly. "I don\'t think," he said, "that I\'ve seen a dragon in these parts recently. But if I come across one I\'ll know it belongs to you, and I\'ll have him taken round to you at once.""Thank you very much," said Charlotte, " but don\'t trouble about it, please, \'cos p\'raps it isn\'t a dragon, after all. Only I thought I saw his little footprints in the snow, and we followed \'em up, and they seemed to lead right in here, but maybe it\'s all a mistake, and thank you all the same.""Oh, no trouble at all," said the circus-man, cheerfully. "I should be only too pleased. But of course, as you say, it may be a mistake. And it\'s getting dark, and he seems to have got away for the present, whatever he is. You\'d better come in and have some tea. I\'m quite alone, and we\'ll make a roaring fire, and I\'ve got the biggest Book of Beasts you ever saw. It\'s got every beast in the world, and all of \'em coloured; and we\'ll try and find your beast in it!"We were always ready for tea at any time, and especially when combined with beasts. There was marmalade, too, and apricot-jam, brought in expressly for us; and afterwards the beast-book was spread out, and, as the man had truly said, it contained every sort of beast that had ever been in the world.The striking of six o\'clock set the more prudent Charlotte nudging me, and we recalled ourselves with an effort from Beastland, and reluctantly stood up to go."Here, I\'m coming along with you,\" said the circus-man. \"I want another pipe, and a walk\'ll do me good. You needn\'t talk to me unless you like.\"Our spirits rose to their wonted level again. The way had seemed so long, the outside world so dark and eerie, after the bright warm room and the highly-coloured beast-book. But a walk with a real Man—why, that was a treat in itself! We set off briskly, the Man in the middle. I looked up at him and wondered whether I should ever live to smoke a big pipe with that careless sort of majesty! But Charlotte, whose young mind was not set on tobacco as a possible goal, made herself heard from the other side.\"Now, then,\" she said, \"tell us a story, please, won\'t you?\"The Man sighed heavily and looked about him. \"I knew it,\" he groaned. \"I knew I should have to tell a story. Oh, why did I leave my pleasant fireside? Well, I will tell you a story. Only let me think a minute.\"So he thought a minute, and then he told us this story.Long ago—might have been hundreds of years ago—in a cottage half-way between this village and yonder shoulder of the Downs up there, a shepherd lived with his wife and their little son. Now the shepherd spent his days—and at certain times of the year his nights too—up on the wide ocean-bosom of the Downs, with only the sun and the stars and the sheep for company, and the friendly chattering world of men and women far out of sight and hearing. But his little son, when he wasn\'t helping his father, and often when he was as well, spent much of his time buried in big volumes that he borrowed from the affable gentry and interested parsons of the country round about. And his parents were very fond of him, and rather proud of him too, though they didn\'t let on in his hearing, so he was left to go his own way and read as much as he liked; and instead of frequently getting a cuff on the side of the head, as might very well have happened to him, he was treated more or less as an equal by his parents, who sensibly thought it a very fair division of labour that they should supply the practical knowledge, and he the book-learning. They knew that book-learning often came in useful at a pinch, in spite of what their neighbours said. What the Boy chiefly dabbled in was natural history and fairy-tales, and he just took them as they came, in a sandwichy sort of way, without making any distinctions; and really his course of reading strikes one as rather sensible.One evening the shepherd, who for some nights past had been disturbed and preoccupied, and off his usual mental balance, came home all of a tremble, and, sitting down at the table where his wife and son were peacefully employed, she with her seam, he in following out the adventures of the Giant with no Heart in his Body, exclaimed with much agitation:\"It\'s all up with me, Maria! Never no more can I go up on them there Downs, was it ever so!""Now don\'t you take on like that,\" said his wife, who was a very sensible woman: \"but tell us all about it first, whatever it is as has given you this shake-up, and then me and you and the son here, between us, we ought to be able to get to the bottom of it!""It began some nights ago,\" said the shepherd. \"You know that cave up there—I never liked it, somehow, and the sheep never liked it neither, and when sheep don\'t like a thing there\'s generally some reason for it. Well, for some time past there\'s been faint noises coming from that cave—noises like heavy sighings, with grunts mixed up in them; and sometimes a snoring, far away down—real snoring, yet somehow not honest snoring, like you and me o\' nights, you know!""I know,\" remarked the Boy, quietly.\"Of course I was terrible frightened,\" the shepherd went on; \"yet somehow I couldn\'t keep away. So this very evening, before I come down, I took a cast round by the cave, quietly. And there—O Lord! there I saw him at last, as plain as I see you!""Saw who?'' said his wife, beginning to share in her husband\'s nervous terror.\"Why him, I\'m a telling you!\" said the shepherd. \"He was sticking half-way out of the cave, and seemed to be enjoying of the cool of the evening in a poetical sort of way. He was as big as four cart-horses, and all covered with shiny scales—deep-blue scales at the top of him, shading off to a tender sort o\' green below. As he breathed, there was that sort of flicker over his nostrils that you see over our chalk roads on a baking windless day in summer. He had his chin on his paws, and I should say he was meditating about things. Oh, yes, a peaceable sort o\' beast enough, and not ramping or carrying on or doing anything but what was quite right and proper. I admit all that. And yet, what am I to do? Scales, you know, and claws, and a tail for certain, though I didn\'t see that end of him—I ain\'t used to \'em, and I don\'t hold with \'em, and that\'s a fact!\"The Boy, who had apparently been absorbed in his book during his father\'s recital, now closed the volume, yawned, clasped his hands behind his head, and said sleepily:\"It\'s all right, father. Don\'t you worry. It\'s only a dragon.""Only a dragon?\" cried his father. \"What do you mean, sitting there, you and your dragons? Only a dragon indeed! And what do you know about it?\"\"\'Cos it is, and \'cos I do know,\" replied the Boy, quietly. \"Look here, father, you know we\'ve each of us got our line. You know about sheep, and weather, and things; I know about dragons. I always said, you know, that that cave up there was a dragon-cave. I always said it must have belonged to a dragon some time, and ought to belong to a dragon now, if rules count for anything. Well, now you tell me it has got a dragon, and so that\'s all right. I\'m not half as much surprised as when you told me it hadn\'t got a dragon. Rules always come right if you wait quietly. Now, please, just leave this all to me. And I\'ll stroll up to-morrow morning—no, in the morning I can\'t, I\'ve got a whole heap of things to do—well, perhaps in the evening, if I\'m quite free, I\'ll go up and have a talk to him, and you\'ll find it\'ll be all right. Only, please, don\'t you go worrying round there without me. You don\'t understand \'em a bit, and they\'re very sensitive, you know! ""He\'s quite right, father,\" said the sensible mother. \"As he says, dragons is his line and not ours. He\'s wonderful knowing about book-beasts, as every one allows. And to tell the truth, I\'m not half happy in my own mind, thinking of that poor animal lying alone up there, without a bit o\' hot supper or anyone to change the news with; and maybe we\'ll be able to do something for him; and if he ain\'t quite respectable our Boy\'ll find it out quick enough. He\'s got a pleasant sort o\' way with him that makes everybody tell him everything.\"Next day, after he\'d had his tea, the Boy strolled up the chalky track that led to the summit of the Downs; and there, sure enough, he found the dragon, stretched lazily on the sward in front of his cave. The view from that point was a magnificent one. To the right and left, the bare and willowy leagues of Downs; in front, the vale, with its clustered homesteads, its threads of white roads running through orchards and well-tilled acreage, and, far away, a hint of grey old cities on the horizon. A cool breeze played over the surface of the grass and the silver shoulder of a large moon was showing above distant junipers. No wonder the dragon seemed in a peaceful and contented mood; indeed, as the Boy approached he could hear the beast purring with a happy regularity. \"Well, we live and learn!\" he said to himself \"None of my books ever told me that dragons purred!""Hullo, dragon!\" said the Boy, quietly, when he had got up to him.The dragon, on hearing the approaching footsteps, made the beginning of a courteous effort to rise. But when he saw it was a Boy, he set his eyebrows severely.\"Now don\'t you hit me,\" he said; \"or bung stones, or squirt water, or anything. I won\'t have it, I tell you!""Not goin\' to hit you,\" said the Boy, wearily, dropping on the grass beside the beast: \"and don\'t, for goodness\' sake, keep on saying \'Don\'t;\' I hear so much of it, and it\'s monotonous, and makes me tired. I\'ve simply looked in to ask you how you were and all that sort of thing; but if I\'m in the way I can easily clear out. I\'ve lots of friends, and no one can say I\'m in the habit of shoving myself in where I\'m not wanted!""No, no, don\'t go off in a huff,\" said the dragon, hastily; \"fact is,—I\'m as happy up here as the day\'s long; never without an occupation, dear fellow, never without an occupation! And yet, between ourselves, it is a trifle dull at times.\"The Boy bit off a stalk of grass and chewed it. \"Going to make a long stay here?\" he asked, politely.\"Can\'t hardly say at present,\" replied the dragon. \"It seems a nice place enough—but I\'ve only been here a short time, and one must look about and reflect and consider before settling down. It\'s rather a serious thing, settling down. Besides—now I\'m going to tell you something! You\'d never guess it if you tried ever so!—fact is, I\'m such a confoundedly lazy beggar!\"\"You surprise me,\" said the Boy, civilly.\"It\'s the sad truth,\" the dragon went on, settling down between his paws and evidently delighted to have found a listener at last: \"and I fancy that\'s really how I came to be here. You see all the other fellows were so active and earnest and all that sort of thing—always rampaging, and skirmishing, and scouring the desert sands, and pacing the margin of the sea, and chasing knights all over the place, and devouring damsels, and going on generally—whereas I liked to get my meals regular and then to prop my back against a bit of rock and snooze a bit, and wake up and think of things going on and how they kept going on just the same, you know! So when it happened I got fairly caught.""When what happened, please?\" asked the Boy.\"That\'s just what I don\'t precisely know,\"said the dragon. \"I suppose the earth sneezed, or shook itself, or the bottom dropped out of something. Anyhow there was a shake and a roar and a general stramash, and I found myself miles away underground and wedged in as tight as tight. Well, thank goodness, my wants are few, and at any rate I had peace and quietness and wasn\'t always being asked to come along and do something. And I\'ve got such an active mind—always occupied, I assure you! But time went on, and there was a certain sameness about the life, and at last I began to think it would be fun to work my way upstairs and see what you other fellows were doing. So I scratched and burrowed, and worked this way and that way and at last I came out through this cave here. And I like the country, and the view, and the people—what I\'ve seen of \'em—and on the whole I feel inclined to settle down here.""What\'s your mind always occupied about?\" asked the Boy. \"That\'s what I want to know.\"The dragon coloured slightly and looked away. Presently he said bashfully:\"Did you ever—just for fun—try to make up poetry—verses, you know?""Course I have,\" said the Boy. \"Heaps of it. And some of it\'s quite good, I feel sure, only there\'s no one here cares about it. Mother\'s very kind and all that, when I read it to her, and so\'s father for that matter. But somehow they don\'t seem to—""Exactly,\" cried the dragon; \"my own case exactly. They don\'t seem to, and you can\'t argue with \'em about it. Now you\'ve got culture, you have, I could tell it on you at once, and I should just like your candid opinion about some little things I threw off lightly, when I was down there. I\'m awfully pleased to have met you, and I\'m hoping the other neighbours will be equally agreeable. There was a very nice old gentleman up here only last night, but he didn\'t seem to want to intrude.""That was my father,\" said the Boy, \"and he is a nice old gentleman, and I\'ll introduce you some day if you like.""Can\'t you two come up here and dine or something to-morrow?\" asked the dragon, eagerly. \"Only, of course, if you\'ve got nothing better to do,\" he added politely.\"Thanks awfully,\" said the Boy, \"but we don\'t go out anywhere without my mother, and, to tell you the truth, I\'m afraid she mightn\'t quite approve of you. You see there\'s no getting over the hard fact that you\'re a dragon, is there? And when you talk of settling down, and the neighbours, and so on, I can\'t help feeling that you don\'t quite realise your position. You\'re an enemy of the human race, you see!""Haven\'t got an enemy in the world,\" said the dragon, cheerfully. \"Too lazy to make \'em, to begin with. And if I do read other fellows my poetry, I\'m always ready to listen to theirs!""Oh, dear!\" cried the Boy,\"I wish you\'d try and grasp the situation properly. When the other people find you out, they\'ll come after you with spears and swords and all sorts of things. You\'ll have to be exterminated, according to their way of looking at it! You\'re a scourge, and a pest, and a baneful monster!""Not a word of truth in it,\" said the dragon, wagging his head solemnly. \"Character\'ll bear the strictest investigation. And now, there\'s a little sonnet-thing I was working on when you appeared on the scene—""Oh, if you wont be sensible,\" cried the Boy, getting up, \"I\'m going off home. No, I can\'t stop for sonnets; my mother\'s sitting up. I\'ll look you up to-morrow, sometime or other, and do for goodness\' sake try and realise that you\'re a pestilential scourge, or you\'ll find yourself in a most awful fix. Good-night!\"The Boy found it an easy matter to set the mind of his parents at ease about his new friend. They had always left that branch to him, and they took his word without a murmur. The shepherd was formally introduced and many compliments and kind inquiries were exchanged. His wife, however, though expressing her willingness to do anything she could,—to mend things, or set the cave to rights, or cook a little something when the dragon had been poring over sonnets and forgotten his meals, as male things will do,—could not be brought to recognise him formally. The fact that he was a dragon and \"they didn\'t know who he was\" seemed to count for everything with her. She made no objection, however, to her little son spending his evenings with the dragon quietly, so long as he was home by nine o\'clock: and many a pleasant night they had, sitting on the sward, while the dragon told stories of old, old times, when dragons were quite plentiful and the world was a livelier place than it is now, and life was full of thrills and jumps and surprises.What the Boy had feared, however, soon came to pass. The most modest and retiring dragon in the world, if he\'s as big as four carthorses and covered with blue scales, cannot keep altogether out of the public view. And so in the village tavern of nights the fact that a real live dragon sat brooding in the cave on the Downs was naturally a subject for talk. Though the villagers were extremely frightened, they were rather proud as well. It was a distinction to have a dragon of your own, and it was felt to be a feather in the cap of the village. Still, all were agreed that this sort of thing couldn\'t be allowed to go on. The dreadful beast must be exterminated, the country-side must be freed from this pest, this terror, this destroying scourge. The fact that not even a hen-roost was the worse for the dragon\'s arrival wasn\'t allowed to have anything to do with it. He was a dragon, and he couldn\'t deny it, and if he didn\'t choose to behave as such that was his own lookout. But in spite of much valiant talk no hero was found willing to take sword and spear and free the suffering village and win deathless fame; and each night\'s heated discussion always ended in nothing. Meanwhile the dragon, a happy Bohemian, lolled on the turf, enjoyed the sunsets, told antediluvian anecdotes to the Boy, and polished his old verses while meditating on fresh ones.One day the Boy, on walking in to the village, found everything wearing a festal appearance which was not to be accounted for in the calendar. Carpets and gay-coloured stuffs were hung out of the windows, the church-bells clamoured noisily, the little street was flower-strewn, and the whole population jostled each other along either side of it, chattering, shoving, and ordering each other to stand back. The Boy saw a friend of his own age in the crowd and hailed him.\"What\'s up?\" he cried. \"Is it the players, or bears, or a circus, or what?""It\'s all right,\" his friend hailed back. \"He\'s a-coming.""Who\'s a-coming?\" demanded the Boy, thrusting into the throng.\"Why, St. George, of course,\" replied his friend. \"He\'s heard tell of our dragon, and he\'s comin\' on purpose to slay the deadly beast, and free us from his horrid yoke. O my! won\'t there be a jolly fight!\"Here was news indeed! The Boy felt that he ought to make quite sure for himself, and he wriggled himself in between the legs of his good-natured elders, abusing them all the time for their unmannerly habit of shoving. Once in the front rank, he breathlessly awaited the arrival.Presently from the far-away end of the line came the sound of cheering. Next, the measured tramp of a great war-horse made his heart beat quicker, and then he found himself cheering with the rest, as, amidst welcoming shouts, shrill cries of women, uplifting of babies and waving of handkerchiefs, St. George paced slowly up the street. The Boy\'s heart stood still and he breathed with sobs, the beauty and the grace of the hero were so far beyond anything he had yet seen. His fluted armour was inlaid with gold, his plumed helmet hung at his saddle-bow, and his thick fair hair framed a face gracious and gentle beyond expression till you caught the sternness in his eyes. He drew rein in front of the little inn, and the villagers crowded round with greetings and thanks and voluble statements of their wrongs and grievances and oppressions. The Boy heard the grave gentle voice of the Saint, assuring them that all would be well now, and that he would stand by them and see them righted and free them from their foe; then he dismounted and passed through the doorway and the crowd poured in after him. But the Boy made off up the hill as fast as he could lay his legs to the ground.\"It\'s all up, dragon!\" he shouted as soon as he was within sight of the beast.\"He\'s coming! He\'s here now! You\'ll have to pull yourself together and do something at last!\"The dragon was licking his scales and rubbing them with a bit of house-flannel the Boy\'s mother had lent him, till he shone like a great turquoise.\"Don\'t be violent, Boy,\" he said without looking round. \"Sit down and get your breath, and try and remember that the noun governs the verb, and then perhaps you\'ll be good enough to tell me who\'s coming?""That\'s right, take it coolly,\" said the Boy. \"Hope you\'ll be half as cool when I\'ve got through with my news. It\'s only St. George who\'s coming, that\'s all; he rode into the village half-an-hour ago. Of course you can lick him—a great big fellow like you! But I thought I\'d warn you, \'cos he\'s sure to be round early, and he\'s got the longest, wickedest-looking spear you ever did see!\" And the Boy got up and began to jump round in sheer delight at the prospect of the battle.\"O deary, deary me,\" moaned the dragon; \"this is too awful. I won\'t see him, and that\'s flat. I don\'t want to know the fellow at all. I\'m sure he\'s not nice. You must tell him to go away at once, please. Say he can write if he likes, but I can\'t give him an interview. I\'m not seeing anybody at present.""Now dragon, dragon,\" said the Boy, imploringly, \"don\'t be perverse and wrongheaded. You\'ve got to fight him some time or other, you know, cos he\'s St. George and you\'re the dragon. Better get it over, and then we can go on with the sonnets. And you ought to consider other people a little, too. If it\'s been dull up here for you, think how dull it\'s been for me!""My dear little man,\" said the dragon, solemnly, \"just understand, once for all, that I can\'t fight and I won\'t fight. I\'ve never fought in my life, and I\'m not going to begin now, just to give you a Roman holiday. In old days I always let the other fellows—the earnest fellows—do all the fighting, and no doubt that\'s why I have the pleasure of being here now.""But if you don\'t fight he\'ll cut your head off!\" gasped the Boy, miserable at the prospect of losing both his fight and his friend.\"Oh, I think not,\" said the dragon in his lazy way. \"You\'ll be able to arrange something. I\'ve every confidence in you, you\'re such a manager. Just run down, there\'s a dear chap, and make it all right. I leave it entirely to you.\"The Boy made his way back to the village in a state of great despondency. First of all, there wasn\'t going to be any fight; next, his dear and honoured friend the dragon hadn\'t shown up in quite such a heroic light as he would have liked; and lastly, whether the dragon was a hero at heart or not, it made no difference, for St. George would most undoubtedly cut his head off. \"Arrange things indeed!\" he said bitterly to himself \"The dragon treats the whole affair as if it was an invitation to tea and croquet.\"The villagers were straggling homewards as he passed up the street, all of them in the highest spirits, and gleefully discussing the splendid fight that was in store. The Boy pursued his way to the inn, and passed into the principal chamber, where St. George now sat alone, musing over the chances of the fight, and the sad stories of rapine and of wrong that had so lately been poured into his sympathetic ears.\"May I come in, St. George?\" said the Boy, politely, as he paused at the door. \"I want to talk to you about this little matter of the dragon, if you\'re not tired of it by this time.""Yes, come in. Boy,\" said the Saint, kindly. \"Another tale of misery and wrong, I fear me. Is it a kind parent, then, of whom the tyrant has bereft you? Or some tender sister or brother? Well, it shall soon be avenged.""Nothing of the sort,\" said the Boy. \"There\'s a misunderstanding somewhere, and I want to put it right. The fact is, this is a good dragon.""Exactly,\" said St. George, smiling pleasantly, \"I quite understand. A good dragon. Believe me, I do not in the least regret that he is an adversary worthy of my steel, and no feeble specimen of his noxious tribe.""But he\'s not a noxious tribe,\" cried the Boy, distressedly. \"Oh dear, oh dear, how stupid men are when they get an idea into their heads! I tell you he\'s a good dragon, and a friend of mine, and tells me the most beautiful stories you ever heard, all about old times and when he was little. And he\'s been so kind to mother, and mother\'d do anything for him. And father likes him too, though father doesn\'t hold with art and poetry much, and always falls asleep when the dragon starts talking about style. But the fact is, nobody can help liking him when once they know him. He\'s so engaging and so trustful, and as simple as a child!""Sit down, and draw your chair up,\" said St. George. \"I like a fellow who sticks up for his friends, and I\'m sure the dragon has his good points, if he\'s got a friend like you. But that\'s not the question. All this evening I\'ve been listening, with grief and anguish unspeakable, to tales of murder, theft, and wrong; rather too highly coloured, perhaps, not always quite convincing, but forming in the main a most serious roll of crime. History teaches us that the greatest rascals often possess all the domestic virtues; and I fear that your cultivated friend, in spite of the qualities which have won (and rightly) your regard, has got to be speedily exterminated.""Oh, you\'ve been taking in all the yarns those fellows have been telling you,\" said the Boy, impatiently. \"Why, our villagers are the biggest story-tellers in all the country round. It\'s a known fact. You\'re a stranger in these parts, or else you\'d have heard it already. All they want is a fight. They\'re the most awful beggars for getting up fights—it\'s meat and drink to them. Dogs, bulls, dragons—anything so long as it\'s a fight. Why, they\'ve got a poor innocent badger in the stable behind here, at this moment. They were going to have some fun with him to-day, but they\'re saving him up now till your little affair\'s over. And I\'ve no doubt they\'ve been telling you what a hero you were, and how you were bound to win, in the cause of right and justice, and so on; but let me tell you, I came down the street just now, and they were betting six to four on the dragon freely!""Six to four on the dragon!\" murmured St. George, sadly, resting his cheek on his hand. \"This is an evil world, and sometimes I begin to think that all the wickedness in it is not entirely bottled up inside the dragons. And yet—may not this wily beast have misled you as to his real character, in order that your good report of him may serve as a cloak for his evil deeds? Nay, may there not be, at this very moment, some hapless Princess immured within yonder gloomy cavern?\"The moment he had spoken, St. George was sorry for what he had said, the Boy looked so genuinely distressed.\"I assure you, St. George,\" he said earnestly, \"there\'s nothing of the sort in the cave at all. The dragon\'s a real gentleman, every inch of him, and I may say that no one would be more shocked and grieved than he would, at hearing you talk in that—that loose way about matters on which he has very strong views!""Well, perhaps I\'ve been over-credulous,\" said St. George. \"Perhaps I\'ve misjudged the animal. But what are we to do? Here are the dragon and I, almost face to face, each supposed to be thirsting for each other\'s blood. I don\'t see any way out of it, exactly. What do you suggest? Can\'t you arrange things, somehow?""That\'s just what the dragon said,\" replied the Boy, rather nettled. \"Really, the way you two seem to leave everything to me—I suppose you couldn\'t be persuaded to go away quietly, could you?\"\"Impossible, I fear,\" said the Saint. \"Quite against the rules. You know that as well as I do.""Well, then, look here,\" said the Boy, \"it\'s early yet—would you mind strolling up with me and seeing the dragon and talking it over? It\'s not far, and any friend of mine will be most welcome.""Well, it\'s irregular\" said St. George, rising, \"but really it seems about the most sensible thing to do. You\'re taking a lot of trouble on your friend\'s account,\" he added, good-naturedly, as they passed out through the door together. \"But cheer up! Perhaps there won\'t have to be any fight after all.""Oh, but I hope there will, though!\" replied the little fellow, wistfully.\"I\'ve brought a friend to see you, dragon,\" said the Boy, rather loud.The dragon woke up with a start. \"I was just—er—thinking about things,\" he said in his simple way. \"Very pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. Charming weather we\'re having!""This is St. George,\" said the Boy, shortly. \"St. George, let me introduce you to the dragon. We\'ve come up to talk things over quietly, dragon, and now for goodness\' sake do let us have a little straight common-sense, and come to some practical business-like arrangement, for I\'m sick of views and theories of life and personal tendencies, and all that sort of thing. I may perhaps add that my mother\'s sitting up.""So glad to meet you, St. George,\" began the dragon, rather nervously, \"because you\'ve been a great traveller, I hear, and I\'ve always been rather a stay-at-home. But I can show you many antiquities, many interesting features of our country-side, if you\'re stopping here any time—""I think,\" said St. George, in his frank, pleasant way, \"that we\'d really better take the advice of our young friend here, and try to come to some understanding, on a business footing, about this little affair of ours. Now don\'t you think that after all the simplest plan would be just to fight it out, according to the rules, and let the best man win? They\'re betting on you, I may tell you, down in the village, but I don\'t mind that!""Oh, yes, do, dragon,\" said the Boy, delightedly; \"it\'ll save such a lot of bother!""My young friend, you shut up,\" said the dragon, severely. \"Believe me, St. George,\" he went on, \"there\'s nobody in the world I\'d sooner oblige than you and this young gentleman here. But the whole thing\'s nonsense, and conventionality, and popular thick-headedness. There\'s absolutely nothing to fight about, from beginning to end. And anyhow I\'m not going to, so that settles it!""But supposing I make you?\" said St. George, rather nettled.\"You can\'t,\" said the dragon, triumphantly. \"I should only go into my cave and retire for a time down the hole I came up. You\'d soon get heartily sick of sitting outside and waiting for me to come out and fight you. And as soon as you\'d really gone away, why, I\'d come up again gaily, for I tell you frankly, I like this place, and I\'m going to stay here! \"St. George gazed for a while on the fair landscape around them. \"But this would be a beautiful place for a fight,\" he began again persuasively. \"These great bare rolling Downs for the arena,—and me in my golden armour showing up against your big blue scaly coils! Think what a picture it would make!""Now you\'re trying to get at me through my artistic sensibilities,\" said the dragon. \"But it won\'t work. Not but what it would make a very pretty picture, as you say,\" he added, wavering a little.\"We seem to be getting rather nearer to business,\" put in the Boy. \"You must see, dragon, that there\'s got to be a fight of some sort, \'cos you can\'t want to have to go down that dirty old hole again and stop there till goodness knows when.""It might be arranged,\" said St. George, thoughtfully. \"I must spear you somewhere, of course, but I\'m not bound to hurt you very much. There\'s such a lot of you that there must be a few spare places somewhere. Here, for instance, just behind your foreleg. It couldn\'t hurt you much, just here!""Now you\'re tickling, George,\" said the dragon, coyly. \"No, that place won\'t do at all. Even if it didn\'t hurt,—and I\'m sure it would, awfully,—it would make me laugh, and that would spoil everything.""Let\'s try somewhere else, then,\" said St. George, patiently. \"Under your neck, for instance,—all these folds of thick skin,—if I speared you here you\'d never even know I\'d done it!""Yes, but are you sure you can hit off the right place?\" asked the dragon, anxiously.\"Of course I am,\" said St. George, with confidence. \"You leave that to me!""It\'s just because I\'ve got to leave it to you that I\'m asking,\" replied the dragon, rather testily. \"No doubt you would deeply regret any error you might make in the hurry of the moment; but you wouldn\'t regret it half as much as I should! However, I suppose we\'ve got to trust somebody, as we go through life, and your plan seems, on the whole, as good a one as any.""Look here, dragon,\" interrupted the Boy, a little jealous on behalf of his friend, who seemed to be getting all the worst of the bargain: \"I don\'t quite see where you come in! There\'s to be a fight, apparently, and you\'re to be licked; and what I want to know is, what are you going to get out of it?""St. George,\" said the dragon, \"just tell him, please,—what will happen after I\'m vanquished in the deadly combat?""Well, according to the rules I suppose I shall lead you in triumph down to the market-place or whatever answers to it,\" said St. George.\"Precisely,\" said the dragon. \"And then—\"\"And then there\'ll be shoutings and speeches and things,\" continued St. George. \"And I shall explain that you\'re converted, and see the error of your ways, and so on.""Quite so,\" said the dragon. \"And then—?""Oh, and then—\" said St. George, \"why, and then there will be the usual banquet, I suppose.""Exactly,\" said the dragon; \"and that\'s where I come in. Look here,\" he continued, addressing the Boy, \"I\'m bored to death up here, and no one really appreciates me. I\'m going into Society, I am, through the kindly aid of our friend here, who\'s taking such a lot of trouble on my account; and you\'ll find I\'ve got all the qualities to endear me to people who entertain! So now that\'s all settled, and if you don\'t mind—I\'m an old-fashioned fellow—don\'t want to turn you out, but—""Remember, you\'ll have to do your proper share of the fighting, dragon! \" said St. George, as he took the hint and rose to go; \"I mean ramping, and breathing fire, and so on!""I can ramp all right,\" replied the dragon, confidently; \"as to breathing fire, it\'s surprising how easily one gets out of practice; but I\'ll do the best I can. Good-night!\"They had descended the hill and were almost back in the village again, when St. George stopped short, \"Knew I had forgotten something,\" he said. \"There ought to be a Princess. Terror-stricken and chained to a rock, and all that sort of thing. Boy, can\'t you arrange a Princess?\"The Boy was in the middle of a tremendous yawn. \"I\'m tired to death,\" he wailed, \"and I can\'t arrange a Princess, or anything more, at this time of night. And my mother\'s sitting up, and do stop asking me to arrange more things till to-morrow!\"Next morning the people began streaming up to the Downs at quite an early hour, in their Sunday clothes and carrying baskets with bottlenecks sticking out of them, every one intent on securing good places for the combat. This was not exactly a simple matter, for of course it was quite possible that the dragon might win, and in that case even those who had put their money on him felt they could hardly expect him to deal with his backers on a different footing to the rest. Places were chosen, therefore, with circumspection and with a view to a speedy retreat in case of emergency; and the front rank was mostly composed of boys who had escaped from parental control and now sprawled and rolled about on the grass, regardless of the shrill threats and warnings discharged at them by their anxious mothers behind.The Boy had secured a good front place, well up towards the cave, and was feeling as anxious as a stage-manager on a first night. Could the dragon be depended upon? He might change his mind and vote the whole performance rot; or else, seeing that the affair had been so hastily planned, without even a rehearsal, he might be too nervous to show up. The Boy looked narrowly at the cave, but it showed no sign of life or occupation. Could the dragon have made a moon-light flitting?The higher portions of the ground were now black with sightseers, and presently a sound of cheering and a waving of handkerchiefs told that something was visible to them which the Boy, far up towards the dragon-end of the line as he was, could not yet see. A minute more and St. George\'s red plumes topped the hill, as the Saint rode slowly forth on the great level space which stretched up to the grim mouth of the cave. Very gallant and beautiful he looked, on his tall war-horse, his golden armour glancing in the sun, his great spear held erect, the little white pennon, crimson-crossed, fluttering at its point. He drew rein and remained motionless. The lines of spectators began to give back a little, nervously; and even the boys in front stopped pulling hair and cuffing each other, and leaned forward expectant.\"Now then, dragon!\" muttered the Boy, impatiently, fidgeting where he sat. He need not have distressed himself, had he only known. The dramatic possibilities of the thing had tickled the dragon immensely, and he had been up from an early hour, preparing for his first public appearance with as much heartiness as if the years had run backwards, and he had been again a little dragonlet, playing with his sisters on the floor of their mother\'s cave, at the game of saints-and-dragons, in which the dragon was bound to win.A low muttering, mingled with snorts, now made itself heard; rising to a bellowing roar that seemed to fill the plain. Then a cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the cave, and out of the midst of it the dragon himself, shining, sea-blue, magnificent, pranced splendidly forth; and everybody said, \"Oo oo-oo!\" as if he had been a mighty rocket! His scales were glittering, his long spiky tail lashed his sides, his claws tore up the turf and sent it flying high over his back, and smoke and fire incessantly jetted from his angry nostrils. \"Oh, well done, dragon!\" cried the Boy, excitedly. \"Didn\'t think he had it in him!\" he added to himself.St. George lowered his spear, bent his head, dug his heels into his horse\'s sides, and came thundering over the turf. The dragon charged with a roar and a squeal,—a great blue whirling combination of coils and snorts and clashing jaws and spikes and fire.\"Missed!\" yelled the crowd. There was a moment\'s entanglement of golden armour and blue-green coils, and spiky tail, and then the great horse, tearing at his bit, carried the Saint, his spear swung high in the air, almost up to the mouth of the cave.The dragon sat down and barked viciously, while St. George with difficulty pulled his horse round into position.\"End of Round One!\" thought the Boy. \"How well they managed it! But I hope the Saint won\'t get excited. I can trust the dragon all right. What a regular play-actor the fellow is!\"St. George had at last prevailed on his horse to stand steady, and was looking round him as he wiped his brow. Catching sight of the Boy, he smiled and nodded, and held up three fingers for an instant.\"It seems to be all planned out,\" said the Boy to himself \"Round Three is to be the finishing one, evidently. Wish it could have lasted a bit longer. Whatever\'s that old fool of a dragon up to now?\"The dragon was employing the interval in giving a ramping-performance for the benefit of the crowd. Ramping, it should be explained, consists in running round and round in a wide circle, and sending waves and ripples of movement along the whole length of your spine, from your pointed ears right down to the spike at the end of your long tail. When you are covered with blue scales, the effect is particularly pleasing; and the Boy recollected the dragon\'s recently expressed wish to become a social success.St. George now gathered up his reins and began to move forward, dropping the point of his spear and settling himself firmly in the saddle.\"Time!\" yelled everybody excitedly; and the dragon, leaving off his ramping, sat up on end, and began to leap from one side to the other with huge ungainly bounds, whooping like a Red Indian. This naturally disconcerted the horse, who swerved violently, the Saint only just saving himself by the mane; and as they shot past the dragon delivered a vicious snap at the horse\'s tail which sent the poor beast careering madly far over the Downs, so that the language of the Saint, who had lost a stirrup, was fortunately inaudible to the general assemblage.Round Two evoked audible evidence of friendly feeling towards the dragon. The spectators were not slow to appreciate a combatant who could hold his own so well and clearly wanted to show good sport; and many encouraging remarks reached the ears of our friend as he strutted to and fro, his chest thrust out and his tail in the air, hugely enjoying his new popularity.St. George had dismounted and was tightening his girths, and telling his horse, with quite an Oriental flow of imagery, exactly what he thought of him, and his relations, and his conduct on the present occasion; so the Boy made his way down to the Saint\'s end of the line, and held his spear for him.\"It\'s been a jolly fight, St. George!\" he said with a sigh. \"Can\'t you let it last a bit longer?""Well, I think I\'d better not,\" replied the Saint. \"The fact is, your simple-minded old friend\'s getting conceited, now they\'ve begun cheering him, and he\'ll forget all about the arrangement and take to playing the fool, and there\'s no telling where he would stop. I\'ll just finish him off this round.\"He swung himself into the saddle and took his spear from the Boy. \"Now don\'t you be afraid,\" he added kindly. \"I\'ve marked my spot exactly, and he\'s sure to give me all the assistance in his power, because he knows it\'s his only chance of being asked to the banquet!\" St. George now shortened his spear, bringing the butt well up under his arm; and, instead of galloping as before, trotted smartly towards the dragon, who crouched at his approach, flicking his tail till it cracked in the air like a great cart-whip. The Saint wheeled as he neared his opponent and circled warily round him, keeping his eye on the spare place; while the dragon, adopting similar tactics, paced with caution round the same circle, occasionally feinting with his head. So the two sparred for an opening, while the spectators maintained a breathless silence.Though the round lasted for some minutes, the end was so swift that all the Boy saw was a lightning movement of the Saint\'s arm, and then a whirl and a confusion of spines, claws, tail, and flying bits of turf. The dust cleared away, the spectators whooped and ran in cheering, and the Boy made out that the dragon was down, pinned to the earth by the spear, while St. George had dismounted, and stood astride of him.It all seemed so genuine that the Boy ran in breathlessly, hoping the dear old dragon wasn\'t really hurt. As he approached, the dragon lifted one large eyelid, winked solemnly, and collapsed again. He was held fast to earth by the neck, but the Saint had hit him in the spare place agreed upon, and it didn\'t even seem to tickle.\"Bain\'t you goin\' to cut \'is \'ed orf, master?\" asked one of the applauding crowd. He had backed the dragon, and naturally felt a trifle sore.\"Well, not to-day, I think,\" replied St. George, pleasantly. \"You see, that can be done at any time. There\'s no hurry at all. I think we\'ll all go down to the village first, and have some refreshment, and then I\'ll give him a good talking-to, and you\'ll find he\'ll be a very different dragon!\"At that magic word refreshment the whole crowd formed up in procession and silently awaited the signal to start. The time for talking and cheering and betting was past, the hour for action had arrived. St. George, hauling on his spear with both hands, released the dragon, who rose and shook himself and ran his eye over his spikes and scales and things, to see that they were all in order. Then the Saint mounted and led off the procession, the dragon following meekly in the company of the Boy, while the thirsty spectators kept at a respectful interval behind.There were great doings when they got down to the village again, and had formed up in front of the inn. After refreshment St. George made a speech, in which he informed his audience that he had removed their direful scourge, at a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to himself, and now they weren\'t to go about grumbling and fancying they\'d got grievances, because they hadn\'t. And they shouldn\'t be so fond of fights, because next time they might have to do the fighting themselves, which would not be the same thing at all. And there was a certain badger in the inn stables which had got to be released at once, and he\'d come and see it done himself. Then he told them that the dragon had been thinking over things, and saw that there were two sides to every question, and he wasn\'t going to do it any more, and if they were good perhaps he\'d stay and settle down there. So they must make friends, and not be prejudiced, and go about fancying they knew everything there was to be known, because they didn\'t, not by a long way. And he warned them against the sin of romancing, and making up stories and fancying other people would believe them just because they were plausible and highly-coloured. Then he sat down, amidst much repentant cheering, and the dragon nudged the Boy in the ribs and whispered that he couldn\'t have done it better himself. Then every one went off to get ready for the banquet.Banquets are always pleasant things, consisting mostly, as they do, of eating and drinking; but the specially nice thing about a banquet is, that it comes when something\'s over, and there\'s nothing more to worry about, and to-morrow seems a long way off. St. George was happy because there had been a fight and he hadn\'t had to kill anybody; for he didn\'t really like killing, though he generally had to do it. The dragon was happy because there had been a fight, and so far from being hurt in it he had won popularity and a sure footing in society. The Boy was happy because there had been a fight, and in spite of it all his two friends were on the best of terms. And all the others were happy because there had been a fight, and—well, they didn\'t require any other reasons for their happiness. The dragon exerted himself to say the right thing to everybody, and proved the life and soul of the evening; while the Saint and the Boy, as they looked on, felt that they were only assisting at a feast of which the honour and the glory were entirely the dragon\'s. But they didn\'t mind that, being good fellows, and the dragon was not in the least proud or forgetful. On the contrary, every ten minutes or so he leant over towards the Boy and said impressively: \"Look here! you will see me home afterwards, won\'t you?\" And the Boy always nodded, though he had promised his mother not to be out late.At last the banquet was over, the guests had dropped away with many good-nights and congratulations and invitations, and the dragon, who had seen the last of them off the premises, emerged into the street followed by the Boy, wiped his brow, sighed, sat down in the road and gazed at the stars. \"Jolly night it\'s been!\" he murmured. \"Jolly stars! Jolly little place this! Think I shall just stop here. Don\'t feel like climbing up any beastly hill. Boy\'s promised to see me home. Boy had better do it then! No responsibility on my part. Responsibility all Boy\'s!\" And his chin sank on his broad chest and he slumbered peacefully.\"Oh, get up, dragon,\" cried the Boy, piteously. \"You know my mother\'s sitting up, and I \'m so tired, and you made me promise to see you home, and I never knew what it meant or I wouldn\'t have done it!\" And the Boy sat down in the road by the side of the sleeping dragon, and cried.The door behind them opened, a stream of light illumined the road, and St. George, who had come out for a stroll in the cool night-air, caught sight of the two figures sitting there—the great motionless dragon and the tearful little Boy.\"What\'s the matter, Boy?\" he inquired kindly, stepping to his side.\"Oh, it\'s this great lumbering pig of a dragon!\" sobbed the Boy.\"First he makes me promise to see him home, and then he says I\'d better do it, and goes to sleep! Might as well try to see a haystack home! And I\'m so tired, and mother\'s—\" here he broke down again.\"Now don\'t take on,\" said St. George. \"I\'ll stand by you, and we\'ll both see him home. Wake up, dragon!\" he said sharply, shaking the beast by the elbow.The dragon looked up sleepily. \"What a night, George!\" he murmured; \"what a—""Now look here, dragon,\" said the Saint, firmly. \"Here\'s this little fellow waiting to see you home, and you know he ought to have been in bed these two hours, and what his mother\'ll say I don\'t know, and anybody but a selfish pig would have made him go to bed long ago—""And he shall go to bed!\" cried the dragon, starting up. \"Poor little chap, only fancy his being up at this hour! It\'s a shame, that\'s what it is, and I don\'t think, St. George, you\'ve been very considerate—but come along at once, and don\'t let us have any more arguing or shilly-shallying. You give me hold of your hand, Boy—thank you, George, an arm up the hill is just what I wanted!\"So they set off up the hill arm-in-arm, the Saint, the Dragon, and the Boy. The lights in the little village began to go out; but there were stars, and a late moon, as they climbed to the Downs together. And, as they turned the last corner and disappeared from view, snatches of an old song were borne back on the night-breeze. I can\'t be certain which of them was singing, but I think it was the Dragon!\"Here we are at your gate,\" said the man, abruptly, laying his hand on it. \"Good-night. Cut along in sharp, or you\'ll catch it!\"Could it really be our own gate? Yes, there it was, sure enough, with the familiar marks on its bottom bar made by our feet when we swung on it.\"Oh, but wait a minute!\" cried Charlotte. \"I want to know a heap of things. Did the dragon really settle down? And did—""There isn\'t any more of that story,\" said the man, kindly but firmly. \"At least, not tonight. Now be off! Good-bye! ""Wonder if it\'s all true?\" said Charlotte, as we hurried up the path. \"Sounded dreadfully like nonsense, in parts!""P\'raps it\'s true for all that,\" I replied encouragingly.Charlotte bolted in like a rabbit, out of the cold and the dark; but I lingered a moment in the still, frosty air, for a backward glance at the silent white world without, ere I changed it for the land of firelight and cushions and laughter. It was the day for choir-practice, and caroltime was at hand, and a belated member was passing homewards down the road, singing as he went:—Then St. George: ee made rev\'rence: in the stable so dim, Oo vanquished the dragon: so fearful and grim.So-o grim: and so-o fierce: that now may we sayAll peaceful is our wakin\': on Chri-istmas Day!The singer receded, the carol died away. But I wondered, with my hand on the door-latch, whether that was the song, or something like it, that the dragon sang as he toddled contentedly up the hill.'),
  Stories(' A Wise Counting','','images/witty.jpg','Emperor Akbar was in the habit of putting riddles and puzzles to his courtiers. He often asked questions which were strange and witty. It took much wisdom to answer these questions.Once he asked a very strange question. The courtiers were dumb folded by his question.Akbar glanced at his courtiers. As he looked, one by one the heads began to hang low in search of an answer. It was at this moment that Birbal entered the courtyard. Birbal who knew the nature of the emperor quickly grasped the situation and asked, \"May I know the question so that I can try for an answer\".Akbar said, \"How many crows are there in this city?"Without even a moment\'s thought, Birbal replied "There are fifty thousand five hundred and eighty nine crows, my lord\".\"How can you be so sure?\" asked Akbar.Birbal said, \"Make you men count, My lord. If you find more crows it means some have come to visit their relatives here. If you find less number of crows it means some have gone to visit their relatives elsewhere\".Akbar was pleased very much by Birbal\'s wit.MORAL : A witty answer will serve its purpose.'),
